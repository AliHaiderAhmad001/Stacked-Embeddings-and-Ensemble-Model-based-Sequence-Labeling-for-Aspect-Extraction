# **Stacked-Embeddings-and-Ensemble-Model-based-Sequence-Labeling-for-Aspect-Extraction**
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a type of text analysis that categorizes opinions by aspect and identifies the sentiment related to each aspect. By aspects, we consider attributes or components of an text review (food or a service, staff etc).

Let’s take an example like the one below. The goal here for the ABSA system is to identify the aspects – food,service,staff – with their related sentiment. In other words:

* food: positive,
* service: negative
* staff neutral.

**"I was offerd a food here in this hotel, I was offered good food with sushi and the serving of food was impressive. But I experienced bad service here. however the staff here was ok."**

Notice that in the same text, different aspects can have different sentiments. In this sense, the output of ABSA is not meant to be a general indication of the sentiment expressed in the text but aims at providing a more granular and detailed level of information.

* positive aspect :- good food (talking about food as aspect and giving positive sens.)
* negative aspect :- bad service ( talking about service in negative sens.)
* neurtal aspect :- staff ( talking about staff with ok means neutral while talking about staff.)
