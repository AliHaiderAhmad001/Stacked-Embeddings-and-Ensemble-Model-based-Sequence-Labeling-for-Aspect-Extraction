But	O
the	O
staff	B-A
was	O
so	O
horrible	O
to	O
us	O

To	O
be	O
completely	O
fair	O
the	O
only	O
redeeming	O
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
which	O
was	O
above	O
average	O
but	O
couldnt	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
Teodora	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
uniformly	O
exceptional	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
capable	O
kitchen	B-A
which	O
will	O
proudly	O
whip	O
up	O
whatever	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
eating	O
whether	O
its	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
or	O
not	O

Where	O
Gabriela	O
personaly	O
greets	O
you	O
and	O
recommends	O
you	O
what	O
to	O
eat	O

For	O
those	O
that	O
go	O
once	O
and	O
dont	O
enjoy	O
it	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
just	O
dont	O
get	O
it	O

Not	O
only	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
outstanding	O
but	O
the	O
little	O
perks	B-A
were	O
great	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
overpriced	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
tasty	O

Our	O
agreed	O
favorite	O
is	O
the	O
orrechiete	B-A
with	I-A
sausage	I-A
and	I-A
chicken	I-A
usually	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
are	O
kind	O
enough	O
to	O
split	O
the	O
dish	B-A
in	O
half	O
so	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
sample	O
both	O
meats	B-A

The	O
Bagels	B-A
have	O
an	O
outstanding	O
taste	O
with	O
a	O
terrific	O
texture	O
both	O
chewy	O
yet	O
not	O
gummy	O

Nevertheless	O
the	O
food	B-A
itself	O
is	O
pretty	O
good	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
mayonnaise	B-A
forgot	O
our	O
toast	B-A
left	O
out	O
ingredients	B-A
ie	O
cheese	B-A
in	O
an	O
omelet	B-A
below	O
hot	O
temperatures	O
and	O
the	O
bacon	B-A
was	O
so	O
over	O
cooked	O
it	O
crumbled	O
on	O
the	O
plate	B-A
when	O
you	O
touched	O
it	O

It	O
took	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
check	B-A
which	O
was	O
perfect	O
since	O
we	O
could	O
sit	O
have	O
drinks	B-A
and	O
talk	O

The	O
design	B-A
and	O
atmosphere	B-A
is	O
just	O
as	O
good	O

He	O
has	O
visited	O
Thailand	O
and	O
is	O
quite	O
expert	O
on	O
the	O
cuisine	B-A

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
Marys	O
and	O
am	O
making	O
it	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
regular	O
neighborhood	O
haunts	O

The	O
pizza	B-A

My	O
Girlfriend	O
and	O
I	O
stumbled	O
onto	O
this	O
hopping	O
place	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O

He	O
cant	O
help	O
theyre	O
bought	O
up	O
so	O
fast	O

Secondly	O
on	O
this	O
night	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
overwhelmed	O
by	O
upper	O
east	O
side	O
ladies	O
perfume	O

i	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
times	O
for	O
no	O
reason	O
besides	O
sheer	O
convenience	O

Obviously	O
run	O
by	O
folks	O
who	O
know	O
a	O
pie	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
disappointed	O

IT	O
IS	O
DEFINITELY	O
SPECIAL	O
AND	O
AFFORDABLE	O

I	O
really	O
liked	O
this	O
place	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
very	O
soon	O

All	O
the	O
money	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
interior	B-A
decoration	I-A
none	O
of	O
it	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
chefs	B-A

The	O
seats	B-A
are	O
uncomfortable	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
sitting	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
on	O
wooden	O
benches	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
seltzer	B-A
with	I-A
lime	I-A
no	O
ice	O

It	O
was	O
pretty	O
inexpensive	O
too	O

Will	O
not	O
be	O
back	O

Dont	O
go	O
aloneeven	O
two	O
people	O
isnt	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O

experience	O
with	O
pickles	B-A
and	O
a	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
meats	I-A
and	I-A
seafoods	I-A

My	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
eat	B-A
family	I-A
style	I-A
because	O
youll	O
want	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
other	O
dishes	B-A

Best	O
of	O
all	O
is	O
the	O
warm	O
vibe	B-A
the	O
owner	B-A
is	O
super	O
friendly	O
and	O
service	B-A
is	O
fast	O

This	O
isnt	O
a	O
value	O
joint	O

Faans	O
got	O
a	O
great	O
concept	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
rough	O
on	O
the	O
delivery	B-A

From	O
the	O
incredible	O
food	B-A
to	O
the	O
warm	O
atmosphere	B-A
to	O
the	O
friendly	O
service	B-A
this	O
downtown	O
neighborhood	O
spot	O
doesnt	O
miss	O
a	O
beat	O

Great	O
food	B-A
at	O
REASONABLE	O
prices	B-A
makes	O
for	O
an	O
evening	O
that	O
cant	O
be	O

Look	O
foward	O
to	O
trying	O
the	O
Ruben	O
upon	O

The	O
only	O

We	O

the	O
Chart	O

to	O
celebrate	O
a	O

this	O
little	O
place	O
has	O
a	O
cute	O
interior	B-A

and	O
affordable	O
city	O
prices	B-A

Youll	O
adore	O
it	O

Two	O
words	O
Free	O

The	O
price	B-A
is	O
reasonable	O
although	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
poor	O

The	O
quantity	B-A
is	O
also	O
very	O
good	O
you	O
will	O
come	O
out	O
satisfied	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Roths	O
twice	O
and	O
both	O
times	O
were	O
very	O
disappointing	O

Worth	O
visiting	O
the	O
1st	O
Ave	O
spot	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
original	O
store	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
second	O

walkup	O
two	O
Fridays	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
two	O

Being	O
serious	O
sushi	B-A
lovers	O
we	O
sat	O
at	O
the	O

bar	I-A
to	O
be	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
action	O

Ragas	O
is	O
a	O
romantic	O
cozy	O
restaurant	O

The	O

The	O
place	B-A
is	O
so	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
prompt	O
and	O
curtious	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
youre	O
left	O
with	O
a	O
mild	O
broth	B-A
with	I-A
noodles	I-A
that	O
you	O
can	O
slurp	O
out	O
of	O
a	O

I	O
just	O
wonder	O
how	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
delicious	O
meal	B-A
for	O
such	O
little	O
money	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O
but	O
do	O
not	O
come	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
empty	O
stomach	O

The	O

so	O
garantuan	O
that	O
you	O
cant	O

Whem	O

so	O
that	O
we	O

what	O

Unfortunately	O
the	O

The	O
cuisine	B-A
from	O
what	O

is	O
authentic	O
Taiwanese	O
though	O
its	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
Ive	O
been	O
accustomed	O
to	O
in	O

I	O
heartily	O

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
review	O
because	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O
so	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O
become	O
to	O
crowded	O

They	O
are	O
often	O
crowded	B-A
on	O
the	O
weekends	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
efficient	O
and	O
accurate	O
with	O
their	O
service	B-A

All	O
my	O
coworkers	O
were	O
amazed	O
at	O
how	O
small	O
the	O
dish	B-A
was	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
is	O
unheralded	O
the	O
service	B-A
impecible	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
magnificant	O

ordered	O
the	O
special	O

branzino	I-A
that	O
was	O
so	O
infused	O
with	O
bone	O
it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
eat	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
is	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
has	O

better	O
and	O
better	O

This	O
place	O
which	O
is	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
months	O

is	O
perhaps	O
Queens	O
biggest	O
secret	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
packed	B-A
on	O
weekends	O
but	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
French	B-A
food	I-A
you	O
will	O
find	O

than	O
the	O

which	O

is	O
the	O

We	O

that	O
went	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
the	O

or	O
sister	O
in	O
my	O

Ok	O
so	O
the	O

around	O
a	O
little	O
clueless	O
but	O
theres	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
servers	B-A
for	O
the	O
crowd	O
they	O
get	O
its	O
fine	O
you	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
effort	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
attention	O

Good	O
luck	O
getting	B-A
a	I-A

picked	O
it	O
randomly	O
without	O
a	O
recommendation	O
from	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
there	O
so	O
we	O
werent	O
sure	O
what	O
to	O
expect	O

Dont	O
look	O
down	O
your	O
nose	O
at	O
me	O

that	O

Planet	O

awful	O

Just	O
dont	O
do	O
it	O

Just	O

Finally	O

Amma	O

for	O

I	O
have	O
experienced	O
in	O
NYC	O
over	O
the	O

2	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
experienced	O
person	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
but	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
took	O
me	O
there	O
is	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
overpriced	O
and	O
overrated	O

Regardless	O
of	O
whether	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
people	O
or	O
two	O
hundred	O
people	O
ahead	O
of	O
you	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
will	O
take	O
your	O

and	O
tell	O
you	O
Five	O
minutes	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
good	O
though	O

bottles	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
are	O
cheap	O
and	O
good	O

You	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
disapointed	O
at	O
all	O

Walkins	O
are	O

too	O

The	O
have	O
over	O
100	O

that	O
made	O
my	O

very	O
happy	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O
if	O
I	O
must	O
recommend	O
a	O
dish	B-A
it	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
pumkin	B-A
tortelini	I-A

They	O
didnt	O
give	O
us	O
the	O
dinner	B-A
special	I-A

You	O
must	O

the	O

Very	O
good	O
service	B-A
and	O

this	O
restaurant	O
with	O
some	O
coworkers	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
and	O
had	O
an	O
amazing	O
time	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
impeccable	O
and	O
unobtrusive	O
the	O
staff	B-A

Our	O

Open	O

well	O
as	O
late	O
as	O
I	O
ever	O
got	O
there	O
and	O
Im	O
a	O
night	O
person	O

The	O
most	O
annoying	O
thing	O
though	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
servers	B-A
seem	O
to	O
be	O
trained	O
to	O
drive	O
revenue	O

Get	O
your	O
food	B-A
to	O
go	O
find	O
a	O
bench	O
and	O

with	O
a	O

Please	O
try	O
the	O
Filet	B-A
Mignon	I-A
its	O
just	O
the	O
most	O
tender	O
piece	O
ever	O

Everything	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
but	O
we	O
have	O
only	O
been	O
there	O
once	O

We	O
were	O
still	O
sitting	O
at	O
the	O
bar	B-A
while	O
we	O
drank	O
the	O
sangria	B-A
but	O
facing	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
bar	B-A
when	O
we	O
turned	O
back	O
around	O
the	O
2	O
was	O
gone	O
the	O
people	O
next	O

the	O
bartender	B-A
took	O
it	O

Something	O
about	O
them	O
being	O
busy	O
with	O
holiday	O
partys	O

The	O
sake	B-A
menu	I-A
should	O
not	O
be	O
overlooked	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
great	O

the	O
drinks	B-A
are	O
amazing	O
and	O
half	O
off	O
till	O
8pm	O

ive	O
been	O
back	O
to	O
nha	O
trang	O
literally	O
a	O
hundred	O
times	O
for	O
the	O
beef	B-A
cubes	I-A
theyre	O
that	O
good	O

With	O
so	O
many	O
poor	O
experiences	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
theater	O
district	O
is	O
truly	O
an	O
excellent	O
find	O

This	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
overrated	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O

The	O
service	B-A
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
ambiance	B-A
are	O
all	O
outstanding	O
and	O
deserve	O
recognition	O

Went	O
there	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
2	O
year	O
anniversery	O
and	O
wasnt	O
all	O
that	O
impressed	O

It	O
was	O
rather	O
pathetic	O
that	O
it	O
took	O
them	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
seat	O
us	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reservations	B-A
however	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
slow	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O
skeptical	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
NYC	O

Its	O
really	O
also	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
are	O
friendly	O

Suan	O
was	O
a	O
recommendation	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
glad	O
we	O
heeded	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
flavorless	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
very	O
small	O
including	O
dessert	B-A

We	O
visit	O
at	O
least	O
once	O
a	O
month	O

It	O
is	O
set	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
small	O
street	O
its	O
on	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
traffic	B-A
noise	I-A

Also	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
popular	O
with	O
families	O
so	O
if	O
youre	O
bothered	O
by	O
children	O
running	O
loose	O
like	O
wild	O
animals	O
come	O
later	O
at	O
night	O
to	O
avoid	O
them	O

Ill	O
keep	O
this	O
short	O

I	O
felt	O
as	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
eating	O
in	O
Paris	O

Lived	O
in	O
Shanghai	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
comparable	O
to	O
the	O
flagship	O
Green	O
Bo	O
restaurant	O
there	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
Cafe	O
St	O
Barts	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A
the	O
ambience	B-A
and	O
wonderful	O
service	B-A

However	O
its	O
not	O
worth	O
a	O
special	O
trip	O

Nice	O
value	O

Giginos	O
in	O
Wagner	O
Park	O
is	O
so	O
enjoyable	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
quick	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
important	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
restaurant	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
host	O
an	O
intimate	O
dinner	B-A
meeting	I-A
with	O
business	O
associates	O

All	O
the	O
NYU	O
students	O
love	O
this	O
place	O
so	O
it	O
makes	O
for	O
a	O
fun	O
young	O
atmosphere	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
here	O
does	O
a	O
great	O
service	O
to	O
the	O
name	O
Cantonese	B-A
that	O
is	O

But	O
nothing	O
stands	O
out	O
about	O
the	O
cooking	B-A

Joya	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
cool	O
spot	O
with	O
decent	O
food	B-A
and	O
a	O
colorful	O
if	O
not	O
relaxed	O
atmosphere	B-A

If	O
thats	O
a	O
problem	O
go	O
to	O
McDonalds	O
and	O
destroy	O
your	O
insides	O

The	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
menu	I-A
is	O
worth	O
every	O
penny	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
both	O
in	O
quantity	B-A
AND	O
quality	B-A

Ive	O
been	O
here	O
3	O
times	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
and	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorites	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

I	O
had	O
their	O
eggs	B-A
benedict	I-A
for	O
brunch	B-A
which	O
were	O
the	O
worst	O
in	O
my	O
entire	O
life	O
I	O
tried	O
removing	O
the	O
hollondaise	B-A
sauce	I-A
completely	O
that	O
was	O
how	O
failed	O
it	O
was	O

I	O
work	O
nearby	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
BEST	O
oatmeal	B-A
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
not	O
a	O
packaged	O
or	O
quickcooked	O
item	O

Always	O
busy	O
but	O
fast	O
moving	O

Too	O
bad	O
the	O
food	B-A
wasnt	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
heritage	O

The	O
menu	B-A
looked	O
good	O
except	O
for	O
offering	O
the	O
Chilean	B-A
Sea	I-A
Bass	I-A
but	O
the	O
server	B-A
does	O
not	O
offer	O
up	O
the	O
specials	B-A
that	O
were	O
written	O
on	O
the	O
board	O
outside	O

Sexy	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
really	O
good	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
onion	B-A
soup	I-A
and	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
ever	O

I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
this	O
Bengali	O
Fast	O
Food	O
joint	O
is	O
clearly	O
my	O
favorite	O

Im	O
not	O
picky	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
gross	O

overall	O
a	O
solid	O
restaurant	O
and	O
at	O
less	O
than	O
40pp	O
including	O
wine	B-A
a	O
solid	O
deal	O
as	O
well	O

Since	O
it	O
literally	O
is	O
a	O
complete	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
wall	O
its	O
a	O
bit	O
intimidating	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
you	O
get	O
over	O
that	O
very	O
quickly	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
friendly	O
staff	B-A
welcomes	O
you	O
dont	O
hesitate	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
help	O
with	O
what	O
to	O
get	O

Based	O
on	O
the	O
reviews	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
this	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
I	O
would	O
reconsider	O
revisiting	O
for	O
that	O
but	O
definitely	O
not	O
for	O
Dim	B-A
Sum	I-A
again	O

It	O

2	O
extra	O
to	O
turn	O
a	O
regular	O

into	O
an	O
insideout	O
roll	B-A
but	O
the	O
roll	B-A
more	O
than	O

in	O

and	O
thats	O
not	O
just	O
from	O
the	O

Even	O
with	O

Joes	O
around	O
the	O

They	O
are	O

I	O
suggest	O
only	O
eating	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
wait	B-A

shorter	O
than	O
I	O
expected	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
is	O
24	O
and	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
good	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
nearly	O
enough	O
to	O
warrant	O
that	O
price	B-A

May	O
the	O

always	O
has	O
a	O

on	O

Ive	O
lived	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
5	O
years	O
and	O
this	O
place	O
has	O
it	O
all	O

I	O
just	O
read	O
Mocaramels	O
review	O
and	O
felt	O
compelled	O
to	O
respond	O

The	O
sides	B-A
were	O
ok	O
and	O
incredibly	O
salty	O

It	O
hits	O
the	O
spot	O
every	O
time	O

For	O
some	O
reason	O
all	O
the	O
seafood	B-A
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
was	O
unavailable	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
Salmon	B-A

Not	O
a	O
large	O
place	B-A
but	O
its	O
cute	O
and	O
cozy	O

Dont	O
be	O
fooled	O
by	O
crowds	O
of	O
people	O

and	O
theres	O
no	O
way	O
out	O

The	O
beverages	B-A
were	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
was	O
good	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
and	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
were	O
incredibly	O
rude	O
and	O
did	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
out	O

Next	O
time	O
we	O
wouldnt	O
dare	O
ordering	O
anything	O
else	O
other	O
than	O
some	O
simple	O
Asian	B-A
appetizers	I-A
and	O
drinks	B-A

Please	O
if	O
your	O
thinking	O
about	O
it	O
go	O
and	O
stay	O
the	O
wait	B-A
you	O
wont	O
be	O
disappointed	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
the	O
view	B-A
of	O
NYC	O
is	O
so	O
beautiful	O

If	O
youd	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
nice	O
light	O
meal	B-A
with	O
an	O
asian	O
accent	O
Long	O
Tan	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
on	O
the	O
slope	O

When	O
going	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
nice	O
dinner	B-A
I	O
like	O
a	O
nice	O
ambiance	B-A
as	O
well	O
as	O
very	O
good	O
food	B-A

For	O
all	O
you	O
lazy	O

that	O
dont	O
want	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
Alphabet	O
City	O
I	O
say	O
good	O
stay	O
out	O

Otherwise	O
this	O
place	O
has	O
great	O
service	B-A
and	O
prices	B-A
and	O
a	O
nice	O
friendly	O
atmosphere	B-A

Highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
as	O
great	O
value	B-A
for	O
excellent	O
sushi	B-A
and	O
service	B-A

This	O
place	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
served	B-A
by	O
being	O
run	O
by	O
a	O
group	O
that	O
actually	O
understands	O
customer	O
service	B-A

A	O
The	O
service	B-A
was	O
good	O
to	O
excellent	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
attitude	B-A

This	O
is	O
my	O
fourth	O
try	O
over	O
a	O
two	O
year	O
period	O
and	O
Im	O
done	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
awesome	O
definitely	O
try	O
the	O
striped	B-A
bass	I-A

The	O
music	B-A
does	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
loud	O
at	O
times	O
but	O
it	O
just	O
made	O
me	O
want	O
to	O
lean	O
closer	O
to	O
my	O
beautiful	O
wife	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
whiff	O
of	O
corriander	B-A

black	B-A
white	I-A
shakes	I-A
came	O
out	O
good	O
also	O

Its	O
simply	O
the	O
best	O
meal	B-A
in	O
NYC	O

Probably	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
again	O

After	O
passing	O
by	O
this	O
restaurant	O
for	O
sometime	O
I	O
finally	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
have	O
dinner	B-A

The	O
seating	B-A
was	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
maximum	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
into	O
the	O
restaurant	O
so	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
your	O
neighbor	O
when	O
you	O
dine	O
here	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chu	B-A
chu	I-A
curry	I-A
and	O
my	O
friend	O
ordered	O
the	O

We	O
go	O
on	O
Mondays	O
for	O
the	O
prix	B-A
fixe	I-A
and	O
our	O
experience	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
has	O
been	O
comparable	O
to	O
Blue	O
Ribbon	O

Tuk	O
Tuk	O
is	O
my	O
second	O
favorite	O
neighborhood	O
Thai	O
place	O
the	O
first	O
being	O
Joya	O

However	O
theyve	O
got	O
the	O
most	O
amazing	O
pastrami	B-A
and	O
the	O
soups	B-A
hit	O
the	O
spot	O

Great	O
bagels	B-A
made	O
the	O
oldfashioned	O
way	O

This	O
is	O
some	O
really	O
good	O
inexpensive	O
sushi	B-A

my	O
personal	O
favorite	O
is	O
an	O
everything	O
bagel	B-A
with	I-A
lox	I-A
spread	I-A
but	O
all	O
the	O
bagles	B-A
are	O
unbeliavably	O
good	O

I	O
wouldnt	O
even	O
have	O
complained	O
at	O
all	O
if	O
the	O
food	B-A
at	O
least	O
tasted	O
good	O
but	O
the	O
quality	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
was	O
crappy	O
too	O

For	O
the	O
next	O
hour	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
crowded	O
lobby	B-A
area	I-A
of	O
this	O
touristy	O
restaurant	O
listening	O
to	O
all	O
types	O
of	O
explanations	O
of	O
why	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
being	O
seated	B-A

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
proprietor	B-A
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
nicest	O
in	O
NYC	O

Also	O
good	O
for	O
client	O
lunch	B-A
meetings	I-A
esp	O

For	O
600	O
the	O
most	O
we	O
have	O
ever	O
paid	O
not	O
even	O
waving	O
a	O
magic	O
wand	O
will	O
ever	O
get	O
us	O
back	O
for	O
a	O
repeat	O
performance	O

The	O
decor	B-A
is	O
dark	O
cool	O
and	O
soothing	O
while	O
the	O
foods	B-A
presentation	I-A
is	O
spectacular	O
considering	O
the	O
low	O
prices	B-A

The	O
Waitstaff	B-A
were	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
suggested	O
swordfish	B-A
for	O
my	O
husband	O
he	O
enjoyed	O
his	O
meal	B-A

The	O
setting	B-A
is	O
casual	O
and	O

IT	O
WAS	O

The	O

The	O
Italian	B-A
food	I-A
has	O
flavor	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
sort	O
of	O
surprising	O
on	O
the	O
UES	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
turns	O
from	O
a	O
nightmare	O
to	O
attentivethey	O
sort	O
of	O
remind	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
NY	O
Yankees	O
of	O
the	O
late	O
90s	O
no	O

how	O

we	O
went	O
into	O
what	O
we	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

HIGHLY	O

This	O
is	O
the	O

in	O
Soho	O

Went	O
here	O
last	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
pleasant	O
experience	O

We	O
parked	O
on	O
the	O
block	O
of	O
Ninas	O
the	O
place	B-A
looked	O
nice	O
with	O
people	O
obviously	O
enjoying	O
their	O
pizzas	B-A

I	O
came	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
highly	O
recommended	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
a	O

For	O
760	O
for	O
2	O
people	O
its	O
a	O
once	O
in	O
a	O
lifetime	O
experience	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
ok	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
better	O
than	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
neighborhood	O
restaurant	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
potstickers	B-A
which	O
were	O
great	O
and	O
a	O
tempura	B-A
dish	I-A
that	O
was	O
great	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
stuff	B-A
was	O
better	O
than	O
Disney	O

After	O
reading	O
the	O
good	O
reviews	O
of	O
this	O
restaurant	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
with	O
two	O
friends	O

While	O
the	O
20	O
entree	B-A
range	I-A
is	O
not	O
overly	O
expensive	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
City	O
there	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	O
food	B-A
in	O
that	O
range	O
and	O
so	O
Sapphire	O
despite	O
its	O
lovely	O
atmosphere	B-A
will	O
most	O
likely	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
restaurant	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
will	O

Orsay	O

I	O
finally	O
found	O
it	O

Its	O

if	O
you	O

Well	O
their	O

The	O

looked	O
very	O
appetizing	O
and	O
delicious	O
since	O
it	O

on	O
a	O

I	O

NOT	O
something	O

constantly	O
open	O
catering	O
to	O
the	O
Pakistani	O
cabbies	O
lined	O
up	O
on	O

so	O
theres	O
more	O
turnover	O
with	O
the	O
food	B-A
than	O
youd	O
expect	O
ie	O
surprisingly	O
fresh	O

I	O
had	O

Yes	O
the	O

I	O

The	O

keep	O
the	O
palate	O
from	O

Have	O
always	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

will	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
their	O

to	O
be	O
helpful	O
despite	O
the	O
fact	O
they	O
are	O
often	O
busy	O
with	O
lots	O
of	O
diners	B-A

While	O
this	O
isnt	O
classical	O
restaurant	O

the	O

life	O
to	O
an	O
old	O
cuisine	B-A
with	O
some	O
really	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
dishes	B-A
that	O
are	O
genuinely	O
Indian	B-A
without	O
being	O
heavy	O
or	O
same	O
old	O

burnouts	O

The	O

truly	O
caters	O
to	O
all	O
your	O

He	O
takes	O
real	O
pride	O
in	O
his	O

in	O

the	O

For	O

this	O

because	O

Growing	O

I	O

were	O
nothing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

All	O
the	O

and	O

were	O
fabulous	O
the	O
steak	B-A
was	O
mouth	O

and	O
the	O

Besides	O

we	O

after	O
the	O

The	O

The	O

We	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
using	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
MSG	B-A
cooking	I-A
in	O
the	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
Bombay	B-A

which	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O

of	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

Service	B-A
was	O
quick	O

Tends	O
to	O
turn	O
people	O

We	O
thought	O
this	O
a	O
prelude	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
evening	O
will	O
be	O
like	O

I	O
was	O
turned	O
on	O
to	O
this	O

that	O
I	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

but	O
the	O

to	O

the	O

Looking	O
around	O

We	O
were	O

but	O
the	O

basically	O
through	O
the	O

at	O

They	O
came	O

the	O

almost	O
non	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
terrific	O
meal	B-A
and	O
our	O
server	B-A
guided	O
us	O
toward	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
wine	B-A
in	O
our	O
price	B-A

instead	O
of	O
allowing	O
us	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
similarly	O
priced	B-A
wine	B-A
that	O
wasnt	O
as	O
good	O

The	O

can	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
rude	O
at	O
times	O
esp	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
big	O
group	O
but	O
overall	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
must	O

My	O

fantastic	O

Never	O
once	O
did	O
I	O

The	O

is	O
good	O
especially	O
their	O
more	O
basic	O
dishes	B-A
and	O
the	O

a	O

it	O
was	O
fabulous	O
to	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
beautifully	O
prepared	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
friendly	O
and	O
personable	O
service	B-A

I	O
usually	O
go	O
there	O
later	O
at	O
night	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
off	O
work	O
so	O
I	O
dont	O
have	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
crowds	B-A
or	O
lines	B-A

Pizza	B-A
here	O

a	O
great	O
tiem	O
watching	O

and	O
characters	B-A
and	O
ar	O
food	B-A
was	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O

After	O
2	O
tries	O
by	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
to	O
take	O
it	O
away	O
we	O
hadnt	O
even	O

the	O

approached	O
and	O
told	O
us	O

people	O
with	O
reservations	B-A

Wouldnt	O
recomend	O
it	O
for	O
dinner	B-A

Sauce	B-A
was	O
watery	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
didnt	O
have	O
much	O
flavor	B-A

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
enjoy	O
Sangria	B-A

But	O
after	O
last	O
night	O
Spice	O
Grill	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
place	O
Im	O
eating	O
indian	B-A
cuisine	I-A

We	O
both	O
opted	O
for	O
a	O
pasta	B-A
dish	I-A
and	O
they	O
were	O
served	B-A
timely	O
and	O
fresh	O

First	O
the	O
wrong	O
bread	B-A
came	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
appetizer	B-A
then	O
when	O
i	O
tried	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
second	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
for	O
my	O
main	B-A
course	I-A

Not	O
sure	O
where	O
the	O
previous	O
reviewer	O
lonk	O
dined	O
but	O
Saul	O
is	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
neighborhood	B-A
and	O
has	O
great	O
food	B-A

In	O
an	O
area	O
sadly	O
lacking	O
in	O
decent	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
spots	O

Tell	O
them	O
Herky	O
sent	O
you	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
free	O
confused	O
look	O
from	O
the	O
waiter	B-A

Make	O
reservations	B-A
but	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
delayed	O
1520	O
minutes	O
as	O
the	O
hosting	B-A
staff	I-A
was	O
having	O
difficulty	O
seating	B-A
guests	O
who	O
arrived	O
with	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
because	O
they	O
probably	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
walk	O
ins	O
being	O
so	O
close	O
to	O
Time	O
Square	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
average	O
or	O
above	O
including	O
some	O
surprising	O
tasty	O
dishes	B-A

They	O
dont	O
seem	O
to	O
place	O
an	O
emphasis	O
on	O
specials	B-A
or	O
fresh	O
ingredients	B-A
which	O
to	O
me	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
good	O
thai	B-A

Other	O
apetizers	B-A
and	O
food	B-A

The	O
noodle	B-A
and	I-A
rices	I-A
dishes	I-A
taste	O
great	O

The	O
food	B-A
s	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
ever	O

The	O
crust	B-A
is	O
thin	O
the	O
ingredients	B-A
are	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
is	O
friendly	O

Your	O
friends	O
will	O
thank	O
you	O
for	O
introducing	O
them	O
to	O
this	O
gem	O

Also	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
your	O
average	O
bagel	B-A
place	O

the	O
food	B-A
was	O
undercookedthe	O
sauce	B-A
watery	O
and	O
the	O
vegetables	B-A
raw	O

And	O
the	O
fried	B-A
clams	I-A
had	O
just	O
enough	O
kick	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
em	O
worth	O
eating	O

The	O
sauces	B-A
used	O
are	O
also	O
not	O
that	O
exciting	O

The	O
secret	O
is	O
the	O
lunch	B-A
menu	I-A
which	O
offers	O
a	O
complimentary	O
appetizer	B-A
with	O
every	O
entree	B-A
ordered	O

I	O
absolutely	O
love	O
this	O
place	O

The	O
rice	B-A
was	O
poor	O
quality	B-A
and	O
was	O
cooked	B-A
so	O
badly	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O

We	O
had	O
champagne	B-A
and	O
caviar	B-A
and	O
felt	O
like	O
princesses	O

The	O
shrimp	B-A
scampi	I-A
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
antipasti	B-A
were	O
plentiful	O

I	O
am	O
surprised	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least	O
and	O
find	O
such	O
practice	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
effort	O

When	O
my	O
dessert	B-A
came	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
candle	O
in	O
it	O
not	O
because	O
anyone	O
asked	O
for	O
one	O
but	O
because	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
must	O
have	O
seen	O
me	O
opening	O
my	O
birthday	O
card	O
and	O
gift	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
special	O
occassion	O
of	O
some	O
sort	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
10	O
10piece	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
combo	I-A
every	O
bite	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
great	O

There	O
are	O
other	O
Vietnamese	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
chinatown	O
area	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
forget	O
about	O
those	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
very	O
limited	O
seating	B-A
and	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
substantial	O
wait	B-A
in	O
getting	O
food	B-A
at	O
peak	O
times	O

If	O
its	O
just	O
a	O
quick	O

I	O

No	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
long	O

for	O
a	O
table	B-A
outside	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
hot	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
anyway	O
so	O
our	O
insde	B-A
table	I-A
was	O
very	O
nice	O

I	O
would	O
definently	O
recommend	O
this	O

The	O
prices	B-A
are	O
wonderfully	O
low	O

If	O

No	O

I	O

and	O
spicy	O
sans	O
the	O

that	O

the	O

overlyambitious	O
usually	O
inedible	O
while	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
still	O
good	O
the	O
restaurant	O
due	O
to	O
its	O
popularity	O
seems	O
frantic	O

For	O
the	O

you	O

this	O

I	O

by	O
its	O
sea	B-A
urchin	I-A
which	O
was	O
heavenly	O
at	O

The	O

is	O
a	O
little	O
scatty	O
at	O
times	O
but	O
all	O
is	O
forgiven	O
when	O
the	O

The	O

Pastis	O
is	O

wonderful	O

The	O

isnt	O
the	O
greatest	O
but	O
I	O
suppose	O
thats	O
how	O
they	O
keep	O
the	O
prices	B-A
down	O

The	O
pickles	B-A
were	O
great	O
addition	O

I	O

ever	O
go	O
here	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
all	O
the	O

skeptical	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
The	O
Minnow	O
despite	O
living	O
in	O

I	O
loved	O

Always	O
a	O

burger	I-A
was	O
not	O

at	O
all	O
my	O

The	O

is	O
spotty	O
sometimes	O
really	O
friendly	O
and	O
sometimes	O
barely	O
there	O

Decor	B-A
is	O
minimalist	O
and	O
clean	O
nothing	O
to	O
distract	O
or	O

Try	O
ordering	O
from	O
the	O

then	O
you	O

ever	O
and	O
had	O
the	O

The	O

JUST	O
AWSOME	O

Food	B-A

great	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
variety	O
even	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
eat	O
vegetarian	O
like	O
me	O

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
meatballs	B-A
and	O
caprese	B-A
salad	I-A
and	O
the	O
beans	B-A
on	I-A
toast	I-A
were	O
a	O
wonderful	O
start	O
to	O
the	O
meal	B-A

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
incredibly	O
tiny	O

I	O
will	O
definetely	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again	O
thats	O
for	O
sure	O

I	O
didnt	O
complain	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
so	O
much	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
alltime	O
favorite	O

In	O
reality	O
to	O
maximize	O
potential	O
diners	B-A
they	O
were	O
still	O
taking	O
phone	O
reservations	B-A
and	O
reallocating	O
tables	B-A
of	O
those	O
waiting	B-A
in	O
the	O
lobby	B-A

The	O
wine	B-A
is	O
always	O
good	O
the	O
tapas	B-A
are	O
always	O
yummy	O
especially	O
with	O
the	O
warm	O
pita	B-A
bread	I-A

But	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
seated	O
the	O
waitresses	B-A
are	O
great	O
they	O
explain	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
really	O
cheap	O
for	O
the	O
service	B-A
you	O
get	O

this	O
place	O
is	O
amazingly	O
bad	O

Compared	O
to	O
other	O
shabu	O
restaurants	O
around	O
town	O
this	O
places	O
wins	O
handsdown	O

Ive	O
been	O
to	O
several	O
places	O
for	O
Dim	B-A
Sum	I-A
and	O
this	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
WORST	O

I	O
love	O
this	O
place	O

The	O
freshest	O
best	O
variety	B-A
and	O
the	O
fastest	O
delivery	B-A

Go	O
to	O
Volare	O
for	O
1st	O
class	O
service	B-A
and	O
terrific	O
food	B-A

Its	O
supertrendy	O
and	O
theres	O
always	O
someone	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
empty	O
seat	B-A
so	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
customer	O
service	B-A
has	O
been	O
deemed	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
essence	O

Dinner	B-A
took	O
almost	O
4	O
hours	O
without	O
any	O
lag	O
time	O

The	O
people	B-A
in	O
the	O
restaurant	O
were	O
pretty	O
obnoxious	O
and	O
loud	O

The	O
sandwiches	B-A
are	O
dry	O
tasteless	O
and	O
way	O
overpriced	O

The	O
problem	O
is	O
just	O
thatit	O
is	O
a	O
sometimes	O
kind	O
of	O
affair	O

Price	B-A
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
Jersey	O
deli	O
but	O
way	O
better	O

The	O
fried	B-A
rice	I-A
is	O
really	O
good	O
too	O

We	O
were	O
well	O
attended	O
to	O
by	O
the	O
enthusiastic	O
staff	B-A
especially	O
the	O
manager	B-A
Tony	O
Gaskin	O
who	O
made	O
excellent	O
suggestions	O
for	O
our	O
menu	B-A

Made	O
my	O
dining	B-A
experience	I-A
uncomfortable	O

Its	O
a	O
steal	O

We	O
went	O

which	O
is	O
supplied	O
by	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
disappointed	O
with	O
this	O
restaurant	O

The	O
drinks	B-A
are	O
always	O
welll	O
made	O
and	O
wine	B-A
selection	I-A
is	O

priced	B-A

We	O
also	O
had	O
shared	O
a	O
house	B-A
salad	I-A
that	O
was	O
fresh	O

The	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
in	O
NYC	O
celebrating	O
our	O
30th	O
anniversary	O

Im	O
glad	O
I	O
was	O
introduced	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
gem	O
in	O
NY	O

And	O
at	O
the	O
conclusion	O
of	O
this	O
culinary	O
nightmare	O
the	O
check	B-A
was	O
given	O
to	O
our	O
table	B-A
by	O
knocking	O
over	O
a	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
water	I-A

Not	O
a	O
small	O
feat	O
for	O
good	O
french	B-A
food	I-A
in	O
the	O
area	O

The	O
space	B-A
is	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
small	O
for	O
live	B-A
music	I-A
so	O
on	O
jazz	B-A
nights	I-A
it	O
can	O
be	O
loud	O
and	O
cramped	O

Food	B-A
was	O
average	O
but	O
tasty	O

The	O

was	O
bland	O
and	O
small	O
dessert	B-A
was	O
not	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it	O

Oh	O
and	O
its	O
too	O
tiny	O
for	O
families	O

The	O
staff	B-A
was	O
the	O
friendliest	O
that	O
have	O
seen	O
in	O
New	O

With	O
the	O
exception	O
of	O
our	O
lemon	B-A
salad	I-A
that	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
pepper	B-A
on	O
it	O
that	O
our	O
eyes	O
started	O
watering	O
the	O
food	B-A
here	O
was	O

The	O

actually	O
poured	O

on	O
my	O

and	O

The	O

in	O
the	O
US	O
that	O

I	O
brought	O
some	O

from	O

and	O
they	O
loved	O
it	O

Inside	O
is	O
a	O
little	O

but	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O

Sushi	B-A
wasnt	O
anything	O
spectacular	O
for	O
the	O
price	B-A

During	O
our	O
meal	B-A
the	O
management	B-A
came	O
over	O
and	O
checked	O
on	O
us	O
and	O
even	O
bought	O
us	O
a	O
round	B-A
of	I-A
drinks	I-A

But	O
they	O
dont	O
have	O
a	O
toaster	B-A
which	O
is	O
strange	O

So	O
for	O
good	O
food	B-A
id	O
recommend	O
it	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
a	O
fun	O
night	O
out	O

The	O
menu	B-A
choices	I-A
are	O
similar	O
but	O
the	O
taste	B-A
lacked	O
more	O
flavor	B-A
than	O
it	O
looked	O

A	O
must	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
Dosa	B-A
lovers	O

The	O
portions	B-A
are	O
HUGE	O
so	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
good	O
to	O
order	O
three	O
things	O
to	O
split	O
rather	O
than	O
one	O
appetizer	B-A
and	O
entree	B-A
per	O
person	O
for	O
two	O
people	O

The	O
appetizers	B-A
are	O
just	O
OK	O
and	O
the	O
main	B-A
courses	I-A
were	O
decidedly	O
subpar	O

Someone	O
else	O
recommended	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
we	O
also	O
left	O
that	O

The	O
exotic	B-A
food	I-A
is	O
beautifully	O
presented	O
and	O
is	O
a	O
delight	O
in	O

The	O

simple	O

hmmm	O

Service	B-A
was	O
prompt	O
and	O
courteous	O

It	O

and	O
the	O

it	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
house	B-A
varities	I-A

This	O

the	O

My	O
mouth	O
starts	O
to	O

merely	O

about	O
the	O

that	O
is	O
this	O

I	O

Oh	O
and	O
the	O
complimentary	O
pudding	B-A
dessert	I-A
was	O
just	O
enough	O
yummy	O

People	O
dress	O
in	O
suits	O
or	O
evening	O

as	O
well	O
as	O

we	O
split	O
a	O
tasty	O

samosa	I-A
and	O
the	O
malai	B-A

Knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
chef	B-A
and	O
the	O

are	O
below	O

We	O
were	O
walking	O
around	O
the	O
village	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
just	O
for	O
some	O
drinks	B-A

Decent	O

selection	I-A
too	O

Go	O
with	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
friends	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
time	O

It	O
saves	O
walking	O
in	O
and	O
waiting	B-A
for	O
a	O
table	B-A
in	O
the	O
often	O
noisy	O
crowded	O
bar	B-A
at	O
dinnertime	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
disapointing	O
meal	B-A
here	O

Its	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
favorite	O
places	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
NY	O

The	O
place	O
does	O
get	O
crowded	O
so	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O
between	O
45	O
PM	O

Mine	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
burnt	O
but	O
still	O
delicious	O
with	O
goat	B-A
cheese	I-A
and	O
panchetta	B-A
raddichio	B-A
was	O
kind	O
of	O
bitter	O
though	O

Disappointing	O
food	B-A
lousy	O
service	B-A

Im	O
from	O
sichuan	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
restaurant	O
I	O
recommend	O
going	O

This	O
lovely	O
FrenchAsian	O
fusion	O
restaurant	O
stands	O
out	O
amongst	O
other	O
great	O
restaurants	O
on	O
Smith	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
casual	O
neighborhood	O
bistro	O
that	O
has	O
great	O
food	B-A
and	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
this	O
is	O
the	O
place	O

great	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
drink	B-A
too	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
100	O
kinds	B-A
of	I-A
beer	I-A

But	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
welloiled	O
machine	O
so	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
theyre	O
doing	O

Over	O
price	B-A
and	O
small	O
portions	B-A

Meanwhile	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
continued	O
to	O
pour	O
champagne	B-A
from	O
his	O
reserve	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
finished	O
our	O
bottle	O
and	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
an	O
amuse	O
of	O
turnip	B-A
soup	I-A
with	I-A
pureed	I-A
basil	I-A
gratis	O

But	O
Id	O
go	O
back	O

Stepped	O
on	O
my	O
foot	O
on	O
the	O
SECOND	O
time	O
he	O
reached	O
over	O
me	O
to	O
adjust	O
lighting	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
impecable	O

BUt	O
their	O
best	O
dish	B-A
is	O
thh	O
Thai	B-A
spiced	I-A
curry	I-A
noodles	I-A
with	I-A
shrimp	I-A
a	O
dish	B-A
that	O
would	O
cost	B-A
2395	O
is	O
most	O
places	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
16	O
here	O

Good	O
dark	O
atmosphere	B-A
and	O
the	O
music	B-A
is	O
a	O
nice	O
touch	O

My	O
husband	O
said	O
the	O
portions	B-A
were	O
very	O
small	O
but	O
if	O
my	O
main	B-A
course	I-A
was	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
the	O
portion	B-A
wouldve	O
been	O
fine	O
for	O
me	O

But	O
the	O
thai	B-A
is	O
definitely	O
not	O
great	O
bland	O
and	O
indistinguished	O

This	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
couple	O
blocks	O
away	O
from	O
Sripraphai	O
another	O
delicious	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O

Great	O
for	O
groups	O
great	O
for	O
a	O
date	O
great	O
for	O
early	O
brunch	B-A
or	O
a	O
nightcap	B-A

Authentic	O
Shanghai	O
style	O
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
a	O
better	O
Shanghai	O
place	O
in	O
New	O
York	O

Our	O
friendly	O
server	B-A
made	O
great	O
food	B-A
suggestions	I-A
and	O
also	O
sent	O
both	O
the	O
sommelier	B-A
and	O
the	O
fromager	B-A
to	O
the	O
table	O
to	O
help	O

different	O

for	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
last	O
reviewer	O
who	O
stated	O
she	O
was	O
treated	O
with	O
attitude	O
lives	O
in	O
a	O
parallel	O
universe	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
anything	O
but	O
a	O
perfect	O
experience	O
at	O
Yasuda	O

That	O
said	O
I	O
thought	O
Scalini	O
Fedeli	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
dining	O
experiences	O
Ive	O
EVER	O
had	O

Everything	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O
was	O
special	O

Because	O
we	O
didnt	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
we	O
could	O
only	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
back	B-A
garden	I-A
but	O
it	O
was	O
great	O
secluded	O
and	O
perfect	O
in	O
nice	O
weather	O

Stuffing	O
yourself	O
with	O
Japanese	B-A
food	I-A
is	O
a	O
rare	O
thing	O

I	O
try	O
my	O
best	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
accurate	O
description	O
of	O
any	O
establishment	O
visited	O

While	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O
certainly	O
no	O
Il	O
Mulino	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
horrendous	O

It	O
is	O
expensive	O
but	O
well	O
worth	O
the	O
money	O

Service	B-A
is	O
not	O
what	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
joint	O
in	O
this	O
price	B-A
category	I-A

Our	O
family	O
never	O
expected	O
such	O
incredible	O
entertainment	B-A
in	O
a	O
restaurant	O

i	O
would	O
recommend	O
reservations	B-A
on	O
weekends	O
though	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
Thai	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
but	O
so	O
far	O
Toons	O
is	O

Great	O
pizza	B-A
for	O
lunch	O
place	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
very	O
expensive	O
we	O
spent	O
160	O
for	O
lunch	B-A
for	O
two	O
but	O
extremely	O
tasty	O

I	O
dont	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
again	O

We	O
were	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
8	O
and	O
well	O
seved	B-A

And	O
thats	O
no	O
mean	O
feat	O

I	O
often	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
my	O
family	O

I	O
wish	O
they	O
would	O
change	O
back	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
before	O

The	O
signs	B-A
the	O

all	O
the	O

and	O
my	O

the	O
sesame	B-A
chicken	I-A

Im	O
no	O
food	B-A
critic	O
but	O
Id	O
like	O
to	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
tiny	O
bit	O
of	O
experience	O
under	O
my	O
belt	O
having	O
lived	O
in	O
NY	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
11	O
years	O

I	O
noted	O
it	O
was	O
crossed	O
off	O
on	O
the	O
bill	B-A

Needless	O
to	O
say	O
Im	O
never	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
wary	O
too	O

Best	O
dish	B-A
is	O
noriwrapped	B-A
tuna	I-A

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
absolutely	O
amazing	O

Some	O
servers	B-A
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
they	O
are	O
doing	O
you	O
a	O
favor	O
to	O
bring	O
you	O
the	O
food	B-A

An	O
excellent	O
alternative	O
to	O
fast	B-A
food	I-A
joints	O
and	O
ordering	O
in	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
slightly	O
disappointing	O

Mermaid	O
Inn	O
is	O
an	O
overall	O
good	O
restaurant	O
with	O
really	O
good	O
seafood	B-A

I	O
work	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
colleague	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
another	O
couple	O

The	O
staff	B-A
is	O
also	O
attentive	O
and	O
friendly	O

The	O
all	B-A
you	I-A
can	I-A
eat	I-A
deal	I-A
is	O
truly	O
amazing	O
here	O

That	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O
since	O
we	O
paid	O
about	O
20	O
bucks	O
a	O
dish	B-A
and	O
had	O
to	O
order	O
5	O
dishes	B-A
to	O
get	O
a	O
decent	O
taste	B-A

This	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
provides	O
the	O
best	O
experience	O
though	O
to	O
both	O
Alisters	O
and	O
people	O
walking	O
in	O
off	O
the	O
street	O

They	O
were	O
such	O
a	O
ripoff	O
895	O
for	O
four	O
small	O
meat	B-A
patties	I-A
in	I-A
steamed	I-A
buns	I-A
and	O
not	O
worth	O
trying	O

first	O
it	O
took	O
us	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
place	O

All	O
of	O
the	O
pizzas	B-A
are	O
terrific	O
and	O
the	O
price	B-A
is	O
even	O
better	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
FOOD	B-A
and	O
Ambiance	B-A
and	O
imagine	O
how	O
dreadful	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
it	O
we	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
an	O
idle	O
engine	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O
too	O

We	O
have	O
tried	O
every	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O
between	O
Atlantic	O
Avenue	O
and	O
4th	O
Streets	O
and	O
Joya	O
is	O
the	O
best	O

Immediately	O
after	O
we	O
paid	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
took	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
said	O
okay	O
you	O
guys	O
are	O
outta	O
here	O

The	O
dining	B-A
room	I-A
is	O
quietly	O
elegant	O
with	O
no	O
music	B-A
to	O
shout	O
over	O
how	O
refreshing	O

Admittedly	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
gigantic	O
pieces	O
of	O
fish	B-A
overflowing	O
the	O
plate	O
and	O
thank	O
goodness	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
but	O
for	O
simple	O
elegant	O
sushi	B-A
there	O
is	O
no	O

to	O
get	O
to	O
without	O
a	O
car	O
I	O
happen	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
Inwood	O

The	O
flavors	B-A
are	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
menu	B-A
is	O
extensive	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
amazing	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
so	O
attentive	O
and	O
personable	O
and	O
how	O
about	O
that	O
ambience	B-A

This	O
place	B-A
has	O
the	O
best	O
interior	B-A
I	O
have	O
seen	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
northside	O
of	O
Wburg	O
and	O
will	O
impress	O
whoever	O
you	O
bring	O
there	O

The	O
food	B-A
has	O
been	O
consistant	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
it	O
never	O
lets	O
you	O
down	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O
sashimi	B-A
plate	I-A
to	O
be	O
satisfying	O
fresh	O
and	O
yummy	O

And	O
forget	O
what	O
you	O
read	O
under	O
me	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
isnt	O
that	O
bad	O
either	O

Dont	O
waste	O
your	O
time	O
or	O
money	O

They	O
dont	O
concern	O
much	O
of	O
customers	O
health	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
money	O

We	O
couldnt	O
carry	O
our	O
conversation	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
routinely	O
interrupted	O
by	O
waitress	B-A
and	O
servants	B-A
asking	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
and	O
hinting	O
that	O
were	O
taking	O
too	O
much	O
time	O
amazing	O
we	O
just	O
sat	O
down	O

sometimes	O
i	O
get	O
good	O
food	B-A
and	O
ok	O
service	B-A

We	O
just	O
ate	O
at	O
Kai	O
and	O
were	O
disapointed	O

Its	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
people	O
who	O
pay	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
mediocre	O
food	B-A
noise	B-A
and	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
their	O
fellow	O
bridge	O
and	O
tunnel	O
folks	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O

After	O
complaining	O
about	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
dish	I-A
the	O
manager	B-A
came	O
over	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
had	O
ever	O
complained	O
before	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
just	O
didnt	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
dish	B-A
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
taste	O
like	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
spicy	O
and	O
delicious	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
my	O
fiance	O
on	O
a	O
Tuesday	O
evening	O

A	O
little	O
overpriced	O
but	O
worth	O
it	O
once	O
you	O
take	O
a	O
bite	O

It	O
was	O
wonderful	O

Went	O
for	O
a	O
late	O
weekday	O
lunch	B-A

I	O
just	O
dont	O
understand	O
all	O
the	O
hype	O

Bartender	B-A
was	O
unable	O
to	O
tear	O
himself	O
away	O
from	O
friends	O
at	O
bar	B-A

Anyways	O
if	O
youre	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
to	O
eat	O
good	O
food	B-A
I	O
wouldnt	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
something	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari	O

Dahkin	O
also	O
offers	O
prix	B-A
fixe	I-A
lunch	I-A
and	O
buffet	B-A

Although	O
the	O
place	B-A
could	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
eye	O
catching	O
and	O
roomier	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
it	O
doesnt	O
really	O
matter	O

You	O
can	O
barely	O
see	O
who	O
you	O
are	O
with	O
never	O
mind	O
have	O
a	O
conversation	O

This	O
was	O
my	O
frist	O
time	O
at	O
Cafe	O
St	O
Barts	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
how	O
delicous	O
the	O
food	B-A
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O

I	O
dont	O
get	O
it	O
either	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
double	O
date	O
with	O
friend	O
and	O
his	O
girlfriend	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
drinks	B-A
and	O
appetizers	B-A

Great	O
place	O
to	O
grab	O
a	O
hot	B-A
bagel	I-A
on	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
work	O

Its	O
like	O
they	O
took	O
leftover	O
chicken	B-A
poured	O
oil	B-A
and	O
sprinkled	O
pepper	B-A
powder	I-A
over	O
it	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
was	O
translucent	O
and	O
red	O

One	O
would	O
think	O
wed	O
get	O
an	O
apology	O
or	O
complimentary	O
drinks	B-A
instead	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
snobby	O
waiter	B-A
wouldnt	O
even	O
take	O
our	O
order	O
for	O
15	O
minutes	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
lip	O
when	O
we	O
asked	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
so	O

One	O
of	O
my	O
favorite	O
places	O
in	O
Manhattan	O

They	O
brought	O
glasses	O
and	O
the	O
bottle	O
and	O
just	O
left	O
the	O
bottle	O
at	O
our	O
table	O

We	O
actually	O
gave	O
10	O
tip	B-A
which	O
we	O
have	O
never	O
done	O
despite	O
mediocre	O
food	B-A
and	O
service	B-A
because	O
we	O
felt	O
totally	O
ripped	O
off	O

We	O
were	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
nice	O
glass	B-A
of	I-A
Sangria	I-A
when	O
we	O
arrived	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommand	O
requesting	O
a	O
table	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
window	I-A

While	O
we	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
food	B-A
we	O
were	O
highly	O
disappointed	O
by	O
the	O
poor	O
service	B-A
waiter	B-A
was	O
not	O
quite	O
competent	O
and	O
SLOW	O
service	B-A
and	O
lack	O
of	O
remorse	O

I	O
for	O
one	O
will	O
never	O
patronize	O
them	O
again	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
great	O
pizzeria	O
as	O
I	O
explored	O
my	O
new	O
neighborhood	O

After	O
hearing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
great	O
things	O
about	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
passing	O
by	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
daily	O
basis	O
we	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O

The	O
service	B-A
however	O
was	O
a	O
bright	O
flower	O
in	O
a	O
garden	O

So	O
again	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O

Stay	O
far	O
away	O
from	O
this	O
place	O

We	O
will	O
come	O
back	O

Weve	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
very	O
good	O
too	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
its	O
just	O
regular	O
food	B-A
nothing	O
special	O

A	O
touch	O
more	O
jalapeno	B-A
heat	O
for	O
contrast	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
good	O
indeed	O

Tried	O

ate	O
out	O
in	O
the	O

worth	O
it	O
as	O
its	O
cool	O
and	O
the	O
music	B-A
is	O
hear	O
well	O
there	O

The	O

really	O
great	O
we	O
both	O

very	O
good	O
didnt	O
much	O
like	O
the	O

was	O
so	O
good	O
neither	O

The	O
lunch	B-A
special	I-A
is	O
an	O
asbolute	O

This	O

liked	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

Im	O
not	O
quite	O
sure	O
if	O
it	O
they	O
really	O
deserve	O
it	O
the	O
Michelin	O
rating	O
they	O
have	O
displayed	O
so	O
prooudly	O
in	O
the	O

But	O
on	O
a	O
lazy	O
Saturday	O

There	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
Italian	O
employees	B-A
who	O
may	O
not	O
speak	O
the	O
best	O
English	O
but	O
for	O
me	O
that	O
adds	O
to	O
the	O
experience	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
eaten	O
in	O
the	O

however	O
upon	O
reading	O
the	O

I	O

Once	O
for	O

Ive	O
been	O
to	O
at	O
Cafe	O

it	O
is	O
probably	O
still	O
the	O
best	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
around	O
Union	O
Square	O

Not	O

the	O
prices	B-A

Would	O
recommend	O
perfect	O
for	O
those	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
close	O

10	O
for	O
her	O
excellent	O
service	B-A
and	O
advice	O

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	O
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	O
a	O

Please	O
save	O
yourself	O
the	O

And	O
I	O
say	O
snacking	B-A
because	O
it	O
really	O
is	O
not	O
set	O
up	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
proper	O

The	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Saul	O
many	O
times	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
always	O
consistently	O
outrageously	O
good	O

Always	O
ask	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
for	O
the	O
SEASONAL	B-A
beer	I-A

If	O
your	O
visiting	O
youll	O
enjoy	O
the	O
ambiance	B-A
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
its	O
in	O
Time	O
Sq	O

We	O
were	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
NJ	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
NY	O
we	O
figured	O
why	O
not	O
grab	O
some	O
food	B-A

sandwiches	B-A
tho	O
pricey	O
are	O
over	O
stuffed	O
can	O
serve	O
2	O
persons	O
easily	O
thus	O
cost	O
effective	O

And	O
comparing	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants	O
is	O
simply	O
not	O
fair	O

Service	B-A
and	O
food	B-A
is	O
what	O
any	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
when	O
spending	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
money	O

LOVE	O
the	O

felt	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
Paris	O

Every	O

was	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
next	O

Not	O
cheap	O
but	O
not	O
that	O
expensive	O
either	O

The	O
staff	B-A
is	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive	O

If	O
presentation	O
and	O
service	B-A
is	O
your	O
thing	O
then	O
this	O
magic	O
show	O
works	O

Apparently	O
the	O
good	O

works	O
then	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
suprised	O

The	O
Yellowtail	B-A
was	O
particularly	O
good	O
as	O
well	O

One	O
less	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
was	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive	O
considering	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
ones	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
hour	O

From	O
the	O
spectacular	O
caviar	B-A
to	O
the	O
hospitable	O
waitstaff	B-A
I	O
felt	O
like	O
royalty	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
every	O
second	O
of	O
it	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
heartily	O
recommend	O
it	O

Would	O
definitely	O
visit	O
again	O

Definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
trip	O
to	O
Battery	O
Park	O
City	O

Perhaps	O
this	O
food	B-A
is	O
considered	O
extreme	O
to	O
an	O
Upper	O
East	O
Side	O
resident	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
whove	O
actually	O
eaten	O
ethnic	B-A
food	I-A
this	O
is	O
simply	O
dull	O

The	O
place	B-A
was	O
real	O
empty	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
because	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
Sunday	O
they	O
ever	O
opened	O

This	O
little	O
place	B-A
definitely	O
exceeded	O
my	O
expectations	O
and	O
you	O
sure	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
food	B-A
for	O
your	O
money	B-A

Ambience	B-A
is	O
delightful	O
service	B-A
impeccable	O

Service	B-A
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
AC	B-A
worked	O
very	O
well	O
too	O
thank	O
God	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O

Tasty	O
but	O
expensive	O

You	O
get	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A
there	O
care	O
about	O
their	O
restaurant	O
and	O
about	O
your	O
experience	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
very	O
nice	O

Both	O
are	O
delicious	O
the	O
cooks	B-A
are	O
friendly	O
and	O
are	O
willing	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
moment	O
and	O
speak	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
shake	O
your	O
hand	O

so	O
i	O
thought	O
why	O
not	O
change	O
it	O
up	O
a	O
bit	O

My	O
friend	O
ordered	O
some	O
of	O
their	O

the	O

I	O
went	O
to	O

But	O
for	O
whatever	O

about	O

I	O

and	O
was	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
overated	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side	O

Great	O
atmoshere	B-A
and	O
worth	O
every	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
most	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O
at	O
this	O

The	O

Great	O

Only	O
complaint	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
at	O
an	O

of	O
1215	O

Id	O

To	O
finish	O
off	O
such	O
a	O

The	O

growing	O
up	O
in	O
Napoli	O

which	O
just	O
shows	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O

This	O
is	O
by	O

my	O

the	O
half	B-A

sushi	I-A
deal	I-A
on	O
saturday	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
well	O

it	O

we	O
came	O
here	O
on	O
a	O
crowded	O
saturday	O
night	O
and	O
were	O
seated	B-A
right	O
away	O
despite	O
being	O
15	O
minutes	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	B-A

This	O
place	O
is	O
cool	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
but	O
French	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
could	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
bistro	O
in	O
a	O

We	O
were	O
fast	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
appetizer	B-A
platter	I-A
since	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
hungry	O

The	O
staff	B-A
are	O
attentive	O
and	O
have	O
smiles	O

This	O

when	O

at	O
the	O

there	O
werent	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
choices	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
dumplings	B-A
in	O
the	O
appetizer	B-A
section	O

Maybe	O
I	O
say	O
so	O
because	O
it	O
looked	O

for	O
people	O
who	O

After	O

time	O
the	O

remembered	O
me	O
and	O
treated	O
me	O

This	O

The	O

by	O
the	O

I	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
family	O
of	O
pizzeria	O
owners	O
and	O
Im	O
almost	O
ashamed	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
Forninos	O
blows	O
my	O

I	O

We	O
ordered	O
some	O

and	O
noodle	B-A
soup	I-A
dishes	I-A
from	O
the	O
Thai	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
menu	B-A
but	O
nothing	O
we	O
got	O
was	O
Thai	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
huge	O
selection	O
of	O
different	O
cream	B-A
cheeses	I-A
and	O
all	O
of	O
their	O
salads	B-A
are	O
great	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
sandwich	I-A
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
spaghetti	B-A
with	I-A
Scallops	I-A
and	I-A
Shrimp	I-A
is	O
great	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
authentic	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
is	O
delectable	O
while	O
the	O
prices	B-A
are	O
quite	O
easy	O
on	O
the	O
wallet	O

I	O
only	O
tried	O
a	O
simple	O
dish	B-A
of	O
spinach	B-A
ravioli	I-A
in	I-A
a	I-A
light	I-A
oil	I-A
and	I-A
garlic	I-A
sauce	I-A
but	O
it	O
actually	O
faired	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
NYC	O
Italian	O
joints	O
Ive	O
tried	O
similar	O
dishes	B-A
at	O

The	O
worst	O
excuse	O
for	O
Japanese	B-A
food	I-A
Ive	O
ever	O
encountered	O

A	O
million	O
better	O
places	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

If	O
celebrities	O
make	O
you	O
sweat	O
then	O
your	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
ride	O
but	O
if	O
your	O
like	O
most	O
around	O
these	O
parts	O
then	O
youll	O
just	O
yawn	O
and	O
wonder	O
whats	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
hype	O

Okayi	O
dont	O
mind	O
the	O
oily	O
part	O
cause	O
most	O
are	O
cooked	O
that	O
way	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
way	O
too	O
bland	O

I	O
ordered	O
a	O
Chicken	B-A
Teriyaki	I-A
dish	I-A
and	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
was	O
extremely	O
dry	O

I	O
love	O
it	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
something	O
really	O
different	O
than	O
try	O
Jekyll	O
and	O
Hyde	O

We	O
had	O
reservations	B-A
at	O
9pm	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
seated	O
until	O
1015pm	O

We	O
had	O
Pams	B-A
special	I-A
fried	I-A
fish	I-A
and	O
it	O
was	O
amazing	O

Its	O
located	O
in	O
greenewich	O
village	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
excuse	O
for	O
such	O
lousy	O
service	B-A

Three	O
strikes	O
and	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
out	O

We	O
bring	O
in	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
ten	O
or	O
so	O
every	O
week	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
had	O
the	O
New	B-A
England	I-A
Chowder	I-A
it	O
was	O
good	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
award	O
should	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Lobster	B-A
Bisque	I-A

So	O
a	O
little	O
inconsistency	O
there	O
but	O
either	O
way	O
both	O
pizzas	B-A
were	O
really	O
good	O

Overall	O
the	O
restaurant	O
is	O
more	O
expensive	O
than	O
our	O
other	O
sushi	B-A
favorites	O
but	O
everything	O
was	O
delicious	O

We	O
would	O
return	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
again	O

Not	O
enough	O
wines	B-A
by	I-A
the	I-A
glass	I-A
either	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
duck	B-A
breast	I-A
special	I-A
on	O
my	O
last	O
visit	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
its	O
a	O
little	O
pricey	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
because	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
spectacular	O
as	O
the	O
view	O

These	O
innovators	O
of	O
french	B-A
indian	I-A
fusion	I-A
do	O
a	O
great	O
job	O
of	O
making	O
dishes	B-A
as	O
interesting	O
as	O
possible	O
while	O
still	O
being	O
accessible	O

Just	O
dont	O
take	O
the	O
seat	B-A
between	O
the	O
bar	B-A
and	O
the	O
back	O
half	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
saw	O
a	O
woman	O
get	O
nudged	O
40times	O
sitting	O
there	O

No	O
gimmicks	O
here	O
the	O
food	B-A
speaks	O
for	O
itself	O
in	O
its	O
freshness	O
and	O
preparation	O

We	O
were	O
worried	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
trouble	O
getting	O
in	O
but	O
somehow	O
managed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
short	O
wait	B-A

My	O
wife	O
had	O
the	O
fried	B-A
shrimp	I-A
which	O
are	O
huge	O
and	O
loved	O
it	O

Everything	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
good	O
and	O
Im	O
a	O
eater	O

One	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
Lucky	O
Strike	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A

The	O
service	B-A
is	O
awfulthe	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
mean	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
needed	O
our	O
table	B-A
so	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
leave	O

We	O
could	O
only	O
get	O
through	O
an	O
appetizer	B-A
and	O

To	O
me	O
it	O

Both	O

over	O
a	O
half	O

even	O
though	O
we	O
had	O

wonderful	O

We	O
were	O
also	O
seated	O
promptly	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
reservation	B-A
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
very	O
quick	O
and	O

You	O

one	O
of	O

this	O

to	O
truly	O

its	O

For	O

to	O
celebrate	O
an	O
occassion	O
I	O
do	O
prefer	O

The	O
one	O
on	O
the	O

you	O

My	O
GF	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
choose	O
to	O
eat	O
there	O
a	O
lot	O
because	O
of	O
diverse	O
cocktails	B-A
the	O
chill	O
decor	B-A
and	O
the	O
decent	O

We	O

flaky	O
apple	B-A
tarte	I-A

This	O

The	O
miso	B-A

lacked	O
flavor	B-A
and	O
the	O
fish	B-A
was	O
unfortunately	O
not	O
as	O
well	O
prepared	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
past	O

Everytime	O
my	O

They	O

a	O
very	O

time	O

We	O
arrived	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
expecting	O
to	O
be	O
impressed	O
by	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
has	O
an	O
impressive	O
past	O
but	O
thats	O
just	O
it	O
the	O
PAST	O

However	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
hang	O
out	O
spot	B-A

The	O
menu	B-A
is	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
so	O
be	O
prepared	O
to	O
spend	O
at	O
least	O
60	O
per	O
person	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
Well	O
worth	O
itsuperb	O
food	B-A

Rao	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
restaurant	O
but	O
its	O
nothing	O
special	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
is	O
extensive	O
and	O
impressive	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
most	O
wonderful	O
waitress	B-A

While	O
the	O
staff	B-A
at	O
this	O
little	O
bistro	O
is	O
very	O
friendly	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
experienced	O
more	O
incompetency	O

The	O
quail	B-A
was	O
fantastic	O
and	O
unique	O
and	O
the	O
pastas	B-A
were	O
full	O
of	O
flavor	B-A

When	O
we	O
left	O
at	O
800	O
PM	O
it	O
was	O
packed	O
and	O
noisy	O

Okay	O
so	O
I	O
never	O
write	O
but	O
there	O
doesnt	O
seem	O
to	O
fair	O
balance	O
of	O
positive	O
to	O
negative	O
reviews	O
concerning	O
Green	O
Bo	O
and	O
its	O
time	O
to	O
speak	O
up	O
I	O
live	O
in	O
Chinatown	O

The	O
zucchini	B-A
and	O
mashed	B-A

are	O
a	O

of	O
garlic	B-A
and	O

which	O
simply	O
melts	O
in	O
your	O

Never	O

Decor	B-A
is	O

though	O
service	B-A

be	O
spotty	O

Aside	O
from	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
very	O

with	O
the	O

the	O

There	O
is	O
usually	O
a	O

it	O

Be	O
careful	O
when	O
they	O

Your	O

you	O
really	O

the	O

for	O
a	O

make	O
a	O
nite	O
out	O
romantic	O
for	O
you	O
and	O
yes	O
a	O

Seriously	O
this	O

kicks	O
ass	O

Food	B-A
was	O
good	O
and	O
the	O

city	O
skiline	O
was	O
terrific	O
even	O
on	O
a	O
foggy	O
rainy	O
day	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
when	O
I	O
went	O

Also	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
thin	O
it	O
gets	O
cold	O
very	O
quickly	O
and	O
its	O
not	O
that	O
filling	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
nothing	O

or	O
Chicken	B-A

the	O

some	O
may	O
consider	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
sweet	O
thing	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
a	O
bit	O
slow	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
friendly	O

However	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
hype	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O

Its	O
a	O
small	O
cute	O
restaurant	O

I	O

The	O

than	O
some	O
of	O

The	O

absolutely	O
horrible	O

Food	B-A
doesnt	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O

theres	O
a	O
high	O

customers	O
at	O
the	O

It	O
is	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
nice	O
and	O
quiet	O
go	O
late	O
and	O
it	O

The	O
people	B-A
with	I-A

is	O
usually	O
a	O
cheap	O
disaster	O
at	O
many	O

is	O
crispy	O
and	O
lightly	O

Not	O
the	O

The	O

Weve	O

with	O
the	O

maybe	O
weve	O
been	O
lucky	O

Drinks	B-A
way	O
over	O
priced	B-A

The	O
main	O
downside	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
the	O
nazilike	O
guy	B-A
running	O
it	O
who	O
constantly	O
complains	O
about	O
the	O

What	O
I	O

was	O
how	O
the	O

think	O
Ive	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-A
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow	O

My	O
biggest	O
complaint	O
was	O
the	O
untasty	O
food	B-A
although	O
presented	O
well	O

This	O
tiny	O
restaurant	O
is	O
as	O
cozy	O
as	O
it	O
gets	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O
Parisian	O
flair	O

So	O
sorry	O
I	O
cant	O
rate	O
this	O
better	O

Most	O

Great	O
roofdeck	B-A
nice	O
group	O
of	O
30	O
somethings	O
but	O
no	O
music	B-A
kind	O
of	O
quiet	O

If	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
the	O
upper	O
east	O
side	O
we	O
would	O
genuinely	O
miss	O
this	O
restaurant	O

The	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
experience	O
was	O
knowing	O
that	O
the	O
manager	B-A
a	O
bubbly	O
friendly	O
young	O
woman	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
smile	O
truly	O
cared	O
about	O
how	O
we	O
were	O
doing	O

Ok	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
growing	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
Village	O
of	O
NYC	O
we	O
have	O
spoiled	O
by	O
a	O
plethora	O
of	O
restaurants	O
most	O
of	O
which	O
stay	O
open	O
very	O
late	O

However	O
service	B-A
was	O
as	O
plain	O
as	O
sesame	B-A
crusted	I-A
Salmon	I-A
I	O
had	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
it	O

Its	O
great	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
lunch	B-A
either	O
alone	O
or	O
with	O
a	O
friend	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
mediocre	O
at	O
best	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
that	O
made	O
me	O
vow	O
never	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

LLOOVVE	O
THIS	O
PLACE	O

So	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
reviews	O
here	O
are	O
accurate	O
about	O
the	O
crowd	B-A
and	O
noise	B-A

You	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
logic	O
in	O
mind	O
Spice	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
grab	O
some	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
terrible	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
same	O

before	O
we	O
were	O

crowded	O
and	O
a	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

Based	O
on	O

that	O
the	O

is	O
overwhelmed	O
after	O
the	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
overpriced	O

soggy	O

Everything	O
is	O

the	O

and	O
you	O
eat	O
with	O
a	O

with	O

this	O

it	O

We	O
asked	O
to	O

which	O
took	O
half	O
an	O

and	O
then	O
were	O

a	O

even	O
though	O
the	O

Good	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
restaurant	O
where	O
the	O
owners	B-A
have	O
some	O
imagination	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
actually	O
pulled	O
it	O
off	O

in	O
this	O

However	O
their	O
popularity	O
has	O
yet	O
to	O

down	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
find	O
myself	O
drawn	O
to	O
their	O
ambiance	B-A
and	O
delectable	O
reputation	O

Where	O

The	O
Halibut	B-A

too	O
salty	O
dessert	B-A
was	O
so	O
so	O
dont	O
waste	O
any	O
of	O
your	O
calories	O
and	O
service	B-A
was	O
poor	O

The	O
view	B-A
is	O
spectacular	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
great	O

The	O
place	B-A
wasnt	O
too	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
packed	O
as	O

as	O
my	O

I	O

the	O

The	O

is	O
wonderful	O

and	O
filling	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
professional	O
and	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
extremely	O
well	O
priced	B-A

Always	O
great	O
service	B-A

I	O
am	O
happy	O
i	O
did	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
awsome	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
many	O
restaurants	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
city	O
and	O
Roths	O
Steakhouse	O
has	O
quickly	O
become	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
favorites	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
casserole	I-A
but	O
what	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
chicken	B-A
all	O
dark	O
meat	B-A
and	O
on	O
the	O
bone	O

A	O
bit	O
breezy	O
up	O
there	O
on	O
the	O
mezzanine	B-A
from	O
the	O

coming	O
from	O
the	O
tracks	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
DF	O
for	O
Valentines	B-A
Day	I-A

I	O
recommend	O
the	O
jelly	B-A
fish	I-A
drunken	B-A
chicken	I-A
and	O
the	O
soupy	B-A
dumplings	I-A
certainly	O
the	O
stir	B-A
fry	I-A
blue	I-A
crab	I-A

I	O
LOVED	O
THE	O
SHOWS	B-A

and	O
i	O
have	O
been	O
around	O
the	O
block	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
very	O
least	O

We	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
meal	B-A
of	O
the	O
yummy	O
dumplings	B-A
from	O
the	O
dumpling	B-A
menu	I-A

The	O
aesthetics	B-A
of	O
this	O
place	B-A
are	O
like	O
an	O
airport	O
lounge	O

Then	O
get	O
ripped	O
on	O
free	O
box	B-A
wine	I-A

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
ate	O
here	O
earlier	O
this	O
week	O
and	O
have	O
not	O
stopped	O
ranting	O
and	O
raving	O
about	O
the	O
food	B-A

If	O
you	O
dont	O
mind	O
presliced	O
low	O
quality	O
fish	B-A
unfriendly	O
staff	B-A
and	O
a	O
sushi	B-A
chef	I-A
that	O
looks	O
like	O
he	O
is	O
miserable	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
your	O
place	O

The	O
food	B-A
itself	O
was	O
just	O
ok	O
nothing	O
spectacular	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
awful	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
yummy	O
and	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
atmoshpere	B-A

As	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
to	O
choose	O
from	O
we	O
wandered	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
street	O
looking	O
in	O
the	O
windows	O
and	O
such	O
noticicing	O
many	O
empty	O
seats	B-A
except	O
at	O
Taj	O
Mahal	O

Also	O
dont	O
plan	O
on	O
asking	O
for	O
your	O
favorite	O
roll	B-A
if	O
its	O
not	O
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A
you	O
cant	O
have	O
it	O

Give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
and	O
enjoy	O

Good	O
food	B-A

and	O
thats	O
saying	O
a	O
lot	O

those	O
rolls	B-A
were	O
big	O
but	O
not	O
good	O
and	O
sashimi	B-A
wasnt	O
fresh	O

The	O
pesto	B-A
pizza	I-A
was	O
excellent	O
thincrust	B-A
pizza	I-A
with	O
a	O
nice	O
amount	O
of	O
spicy	O
Italian	B-A
cheese	I-A
that	O
Id	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
before	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
attention	O
from	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
cats	O
running	O
around	O
that	O
kept	O
batting	O
at	O
my	O
table	O

if	O
your	O
into	O
thaiyou	O
cannot	O
miss	O
this	O
great	O
restaurant	O

Going	O
to	O
Ballatos	O
is	O
like	O
coming	O
home	O
and	O
eating	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
kitchen	O
an	O
absolute	O
delight	O

try	O
the	O
spicy	O
shrimp	B-A
appetizer	I-A
again	O
not	O
the	O
greatest	O
value	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
worth	O
the	O
price	B-A
and	O
the	O
lamb	B-A
vindaloo	I-A
is	O
great	O

However	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
and	O
consider	O
the	O
food	B-A
just	O
a	O
companion	O
for	O
a	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
world	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
underrated	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

for	O
outoftowners	O
who	O
will	O
get	O
a	O
big	O
thrill	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
location	O

Everyone	O
that	O
has	O
ever	O
come	O
here	O
with	O
me	O
has	O
become	O
a	O
convert	O
and	O
returned	O
regularly	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
friends	O

Food	B-A
was	O
good	O
not	O
great	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
wait	B-A
or	O
another	O
visit	O

I	O
go	O
at	O
least	O
3	O
times	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
disappointed	O

Obviously	O
the	O
Chinese	O
translation	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
Big	O
Wong	O
it	O
actually	O
means	O
Great	O
Prosperity	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
too	O
loud	O
when	O
full	O
to	O
be	O
romantic	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
so	O
many	O
dinners	B-A
here	O
and	O
its	O
always	O
been	O
perfect	O
on	O
a	O
date	O
with	O
my	O
husband	O
with	O
my	O
mom	O
with	O
girlfriends	O
and	O
larger	O
groups	O

When	O
you	O
want	O
a	O

head	O
on	O
over	O

Delicate	O
spices	B-A
onions	B-A
eggs	B-A
and	O
a	O
kickass	O
roti	B-A

Incredible	O
food	B-A
at	O
a	O
very	O
agreable	O
price	B-A
brings	O
me	O
back	O
just	O
about	O
every	O
other	O
day	O
to	O
this	O
authentic	O
Thai	O
restaurant	O

I	O
actually	O
gave	O
Patroon	O
another	O
chance	O
before	O
writing	O
this	O
but	O
the	O
second	O
visit	O
was	O
even	O
worse	O

Also	O
if	O
you	O
dont	O
want	O
to	O
sit	O
at	O
a	O
certain	O
table	B-A
you	O
dont	O
have	O
to	O

Unbelievable	O

A	O
little	O
pricey	O
but	O
it	O
really	O
hits	O
the	O
spot	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
morning	O

Ive	O
been	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
Columbia	O
University	O
area	O
for	O
about	O
10	O
years	O
with	O
3	O
kids	O
now	O
in	O
their	O
teens	O

The	O
menu	B-A
has	O
lots	O
of	O
options	O
I	O
hope	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
try	O
those	O
potato	B-A
pancakes	I-A

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
on	O
a	O
saturday	O
or	O
sunday	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
on	O
my	O
mind	O
is	O
when	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
will	O
be	O
getting	O
to	O
fried	B-A
dumpling	I-A

The	O
staff	B-A
isnt	O
the	O
friendliest	O
or	O
most	O
competent	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
stickler	O
for	O
service	B-A
but	O
everything	O
else	O
about	O
this	O
place	O
makes	O
up	O
for	O
it	O

My	O
wife	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
usually	O
only	O
order	O
one	O
primi	B-A
and	O
one	O
secondi	B-A
and	O
split	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
offer	O
large	O
portions	B-A

This	O
restaurant	O
was	O
way	O
overhyped	O

Ive	O
overheard	O
comments	O
from	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
employees	B-A
that	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
delivered	O
in	O
the	O
dining	B-A
area	I-A
and	O
Ive	O
been	O
sitting	O
there	O
while	O
he	O
lectured	O
another	O

Delicious	O

too	O

Now	O
at	O

I	O
cannot	O
imagine	O
you	O
not	O
rushing	O

there	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O

experience	I-A
Ive	O
ever	O
had	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
coming	O
here	O
for	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
nothing	O
but	O
good	O
things	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
the	O
service	B-A
and	O
the	O
great	O
staff	B-A
at	O
La	O
Lanterna	O

Just	O
bring	O
someone	O
who	O
speaks	O
Cantonese	O
because	O

may	O
not	O

you	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O

and	O
gone	O
to	O
heaven	O

Not	O
someplace	O
I	O
would	O

if	O
I	O

in	O

again	O
I	O
will	O
certainly	O
stop	O
by	O

The	O
bruschetta	B-A

are	O
so	O

Food	B-A
was	O

Every	O

I	O
recently	O
tried	O
Suan	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
great	O

A	O
little	O
noise	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
was	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
party	O

It	O
is	O
run	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
Sichuan	B-A

The	O
first	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

We	O

that	O
I	O

Their	O

considering	O
the	O

definitely	O
a	O
good	O
place	B-A
to	O
bring	O

They	O

FAST	O

It	O

with	O

a	O

and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
being	O
the	O

we	O

the	O

The	O

is	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
its	O

very	O
abrupt	O
with	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
and	O
actually	O
claimed	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
late	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
rice	B-A

After	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
sashimi	B-A
order	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
believe	O
how	O
small	O
the	O
portions	B-A
were	O

After	O
the	O
main	B-A
course	I-A
came	O
we	O
didnt	O
see	O
our	O
waiter	B-A
for	O
at	O
least	O
40	O
MINUTES	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
on	O
my	O
to	O
do	O
list	O
the	O
next	O
visit	O
to	O
NYC	O

Nothing	O
better	O
than	O
buying	O
a	O
snapple	B-A
for	O
325	O
too	O

When	O
family	O
came	O
in	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
apps	B-A
to	O
test	O
their	O
palets	O
and	O
then	O
ordered	O
for	O
them	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
gem	O
in	O
Hoboken	O

Service	B-A
is	O
extraordinary	O
yet	O
not	O
overbearing	O
and	O
the	O
decor	B-A
brings	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
trendy	O
SoHo	O
into	O
Queens	O

The	O
dosas	B-A
are	O
skimpy	O
unattractive	O
and	O
drip	O
with	O
grease	O
and	O
personally	O
Id	O
drink	O
popcorn	B-A
topping	I-A
before	O
Id	O
eat	O
another	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O

If	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
a	O
crappy	O
scene	B-A
and	O
annoying	O
customers	B-A
Id	O
go	O
out	O
in	O
Manhattan	O

After	O
a	O
seafood	B-A
craving	O
i	O
checked	O
citysearch	O
and	O
chose	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Fish	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
previous	O
review	O
and	O
the	O
citysearch	O

Right	O
off	O
the	O
major	O
deegan	O
you	O
get	O
ladies	B-A
from	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
city	O

Until	O
you	O
realize	O
that	O
their	O
five	O
minutes	O
is	O
meaningless	O
and	O
your	O
wait	B-A
may	O
be	O
anywhere	O
from	O
two	O
to	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
frustrating	O

always	O
fresh	O
and	O
delicious	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
very	O
thai	O

Thalia	O
is	O
a	O
beautiful	O

with	O

you	O

the	O

doesnt	O
quite	O

up	O

The	O

may	O
be	O

but	O
the	O

is	O
definitely	O

the	O

The	O

that	O
I	O
ordered	O
was	O
as	O

that	O
I	O

in	O
it	O
they	O

a	O

A	O

Bravissimo	O

Once	O
they	O
ran	O
out	O
of	O
Gnochi	B-A
and	O
made	O
it	O
for	O

We	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
thank	O
Marcelo	O
and	O
Grace	O
for	O
a	O
wonderful	O

experience	O

Found	O
service	B-A
above	O

that	O
could	O
be	O
because	O
we	O
were	O

I	O

this	O

the	O

they	O

where	O
its	O

Overall	O
a	O

But	O
hey	O
there	O
is	O
anything	O
better	O
with	O
a	O

We	O

that	O
the	O

and	O
I	O

I	O
had	O

The	O
chicken	B-A

was	O
edible	O
but	O
had	O

the	O

of	O

I	O

a	O

I	O
do	O

To	O

of	O
the	O
Park	O

The	O
red	B-A

is	O
weak	O
and	O
tasteless	O
the	O
pad	B-A
thai	I-A
is	O
stuck	O
together	O

lumpy	O
the	O
rice	B-A

and	O
the	O
seafood	B-A

The	O

easily	O
hike	O
up	O
an	O
otherwise	O
reasonably	O

meal	B-A

Saul	B-A
is	O
pretty	O
good	O
but	O
definitely	O
not	O
great	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
Roxys	O
for	O
that	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
their	O

We	O
always	O
get	O
a	O

Price	B-A
Ratio	O

It	O
is	O
nearly	O

to	O

so	O
if	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
the	O

to	O
go	O
here	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
DO	O

pass	O
it	O
up	O

Their	O
pad	B-A
penang	I-A
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O
is	O
fantastic	O

The	O
puke	O
green	O
walls	B-A
leave	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
very	O
good	O

The	O
flavors	B-A
are	O
very	O
fresh	O
and	O
pretty	O
inobtrusive	O
nothing	O

I	O
like	O

it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A

The	O
hanger	B-A
steak	I-A
was	O

rubber	O
and	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
was	O
flavorless	O
not	O
to	O

it	O

we	O

the	O

more	O
about	O

any	O

the	O

at	O
this	O
quasithai	B-A

By	O

the	O

I	O
have	O

in	O
a	O

Suan	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
that	O
I	O
often	O
take	O
my	O
friends	O

too	O

Not	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
for	O
family	O
or	O
general	O
dining	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
bar	B-A
this	O
is	O
another	O
bad	O
idea	O

Their	O
bagels	B-A
are	O
fine	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
overcooked	O
and	O
not	O
really	O
a	O
special	O
bagel	B-A
experience	O

Unlike	O
HH	O
up	O
the	O
block	O
this	O
place	O
actually	O
gives	O
you	O
hearty	O
and	O
hot	O
bagels	B-A
this	O
town	O
is	O
known	O
for	O

I	O
thought	O
going	O
to	O
Jimmys	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
real	O
Domincan	O
exprience	O

The	O
barebecued	B-A
salmon	I-A
is	O
elegantly	O
spiced	O
and	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
dry	O

Same	O
owner	B-A
as	O
the	O
guy	O
who	O
owns	O
Typhoon	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
down	O
the	O
street	O
on	O
St	O
Marks	O
and	O
1st	O

What	O
generous	O
portions	B-A

The	O
workers	B-A
there	O
also	O
absolutely	O
load	O
the	O
bagel	B-A
with	O
cream	B-A
cheese	I-A
gets	O
a	O
little	O
messy	O

I	O
was	O
wrong	O

The	O
wine	B-A
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
very	O
good	O
too	O

So	O
the	O
menu	B-A
is	O
written	O
in	O
chalk	O
above	O
your	O
head	O
and	O
it	O
all	O
sounds	O
delicious	O

The	O
highly	O
spiced	O
chai	B-A
tea	I-A
was	O
great	O
too	O

No	O
plans	O
to	O
return	O
anytime	O
soon	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
many	O
times	O
and	O
food	B-A
is	O
good	O
and	O
consistent	O

Seriously	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
all	O
you	O
can	O
eat	O
in	O
town	O
As	O
everyone	O
says	O
the	O
Spicy	B-A
Tuna	I-A
hand	I-A
rolls	I-A
are	O
the	O
best	O
have	O
4	O
of	O
these	O
and	O
youve	O
broken	O
even	O

There	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
place	O
in	O
Chinatown	O
where	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
nice	O
neighborhood	O
feeling	O
like	O
here	O

While	O
Sapphire	O
is	O
certainly	O
not	O
lacking	O
in	O
ambiance	B-A
and	O
probably	O
has	O
the	O
best	O
decor	B-A
of	O
any	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
City	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
hoped	O
for	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anyone	O
looking	O
for	O
a	O
casual	O
atmosphere	B-A
that	O
whisks	O
you	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Seine	O

I	O
just	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
the	O
fuss	O
is	O
all	O
about	O

The	O
meat	B-A
dishes	I-A
were	O
only	O
soso	O

His	O
wife	O
Tanya	O
the	O
hostess	B-A
completes	O
the	O
comforting	O
atmosphere	B-A
by	O
being	O
delightfully	O
warm	O
and	O
gracious	O

We	O
liked	O
it	O
so	O

of	O
standard	O
brassiere	B-A
food	I-A
better	O
then	O
places	O

Balthazar	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
longtime	O
fan	O
of	O
Holy	O
Basil	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
and	O
while	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
their	O
food	B-A
has	O
slightly	O
slipped	O
in	O
quality	B-A
I	O
have	O
been	O
hesitant	O
to	O
be	O
disloyal	O

But	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
about	O
LS	O
is	O
the	O
late	O
night	O
atmosphere	B-A
delightfully	O
free	O
of	O
the	O

The	O

much	O
of	O
anything	O

The	O

is	O
descent	O
even	O
when	O
this	O
small	O

This	O

Great	O

the	O
fabulous	O
Cakebread	B-A
Cabernet	I-A
we	O
were	O
drinking	O
the	O
whole	O
evening	O
was	O
amazing	O

Truly	O
the	O
mark	O
of	O
an	O
attentive	O
waiter	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O

I	O
got	O
an	O
excellent	O
piece	O
of	O
cheesecake	B-A
and	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
other	O
nice	O
pastries	B-A

The	O
staff	B-A
is	O
very	O
kind	O
and	O
well	O
trained	O
theyre	O
fast	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
prompt	O
to	O
jump	O
behind	O
the	O
bar	B-A
and	O
fix	O
drinks	B-A
they	O
know	O
details	O
of	O
every	O
item	O
in	O
the	O
menu	B-A
and	O
make	O
excelent	O
recomendations	O

The	O
makhani	B-A
was	O
OK	O
the	O
korma	B-A
was	O
bland	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
inventive	O
but	O
still	O
keeps	O
traditional	O
indian	O
flavoring	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
WOW	O

though	O
the	O
service	B-A
could	O
be	O
better	O
possibly	O
due	O
to	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
very	O
large	O
group	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
cordial	O
and	O
warm	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
general	O
clientele	O

The	O
decor	B-A
in	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
very	O
dinerish	O
and	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	B-A
you	O
expect	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
not	O
romantic	O
just	O
simple	O
small	O
and	O
sparse	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
cute	O
place	B-A
and	O
could	O
be	O
good	O
but	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
act	O
together	O

The	O
lox	B-A
is	O
always	O
fresh	O
too	O

Sure	O
enough	O
exactly	O
30	O
minutes	O
later	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
call	O
and	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	O

Service	B-A
was	O
very	O
friendly	O

So	O
all	O
Im	O
trying	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
thai	B-A
food	I-A
restaurant	O
Ive	O
ever	O
been	O
to	O

Food	B-A
was	O
OK	O
fish	B-A
was	O
cooked	O
well	O

We	O
actually	O
left	O
hungry	O
and	O
went	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Wo	O
Hop	O
at	O
15	O
Mott	O
street	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
chinese	B-A
food	I-A

The	O
duck	B-A
confit	I-A
is	O
always	O

and	O
the	O
foie	B-A
gras	I-A
terrine	I-A
with	I-A
figs	I-A
was	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-A
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O

The	O
service	B-A
does	O
sometimes	O
lack	O
focus	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
ideal	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
treated	O
rudely	O

The	O
staff	B-A
offers	O
impeccable	O
service	B-A

The	O
catch	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
charged	O
extra	O
for	O
ANYTHING	O
that	O
you	O
leave	O
on	O
your	O
plate	O
so	O
dont	O
be	O
a	O
greedy	O
pig	O

value	B-A
and	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
I	O
tasted	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

great	O
experience	O
overall	O

PERFECT	O
FOR	O
DATES	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
boring	O
and	O
expensive	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O
conversation	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	B-A
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O

Terrific	O
menu	B-A
full	O
of	O
unique	O
rolls	B-A
and	O
special	O
dishes	B-A

The	O

but	O
could	O
be	O
better	O

We	O
love	O
the	O

I	O

The	O

If	O
you	O

in	O
search	O

no	O
further	O
than	O
the	O
famous	O
and	O
historic	O
Katzs	O
Deli	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
Lower	O
East	O
Side	O

Even	O
upon	O
delivery	O
their	O
juicy	O
pork	B-A
buns	I-A
are	O
quite	O
good	O

This	O
is	O
also	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
from	O

Everything	O
is	O
for	O
sale	O
in	O
here	O
including	O
the	O
sculptured	O
iron	O

on	O
the	O

Average	O
to	O
good	O
Thai	B-A
food	I-A
but	O
terrible	O
delivery	B-A

The	O
space	B-A
is	O
nice	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
order	O
our	O
drink	B-A
we	O
were	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
surprise	O

The	O
entire	O
place	B-A
and	O
the	O
treatment	O
we	O
received	O
felt	O
as	O
a	O
conveyor	O
belt	O

Joes	O
Pizza	O
used	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
slice	B-A
until	O
this	O
pizzeria	O
opened	O
up	O

I	O
in	O
all	O
reality	O
felt	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
off	O
Air	O
France	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
8th	O
District	O
in	O
Paris	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
anything	O
like	O
it	O

Yeah	O
the	O
crowd	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
a	O
bit	O
seriously	O
but	O
it	O
shouldnt	O

And	O
they	O
provided	O
a	O
delicious	O
dessert	B-A
on	O
the	O
house	O

They	O
are	O
still	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
ages	O
and	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
an	O
answering	O
machine	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	B-A
you	O
are	O
limited	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
amazing	O
rich	O
pastas	B-A
and	O
fresh	O
doughy	O
pizza	B-A

Food	B-A
was	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
consider	O
out	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
had	O

The	O

very	O
reasonable	O

Dessert	B-A
cant	O
be	O

It	O
can	O

a	O
little	O
confusing	O
as	O
to	O
where	O
one	O
goes	O
to	O

once	O
the	O

the	O
some	O

of	O
the	O

if	O
you	O

definitely	O
worth	O
the	O

This	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
lovely	O

we	O

The	O

I	O
have	O

You	O
will	O
pay	O
a	O
lot	O
for	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
no	O
better	O
or	O
worse	O
than	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
Chinese	O

Our	O

it	O
too	O

The	O
service	B-A
is	O
not	O
consistently	O

just	O
decent	O

The	O
food	B-A
served	B-A
in	O
small	O
tasting	O
portions	B-A
as	O
an	O
option	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
with	O
each	O

being	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
next	O

You	O
guys	O
are	O
awesome	O

They	O
do	O
cater	B-A
to	O
American	O

but	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
it	O
hot	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
than	O
willing	O
to	O
oblige	O

I	O
loved	O
this	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
cant	O
go	O
on	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
how	O
delicious	O
that	O
was	O
and	O
the	O
presentation	B-A
was	O
beatiful	O

I	O
care	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
food	B-A
and	O
ambience	B-A

Oh	O
but	O
wait	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
drinks	B-A
which	O
were	O
also	O
delightfully	O
overpriced	O

Avoid	O
at	O
all	O
costs	O

I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
everyone	O
for	O
any	O

The	O
service	B-A
is	O
fantastic	O

I	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
try	O
this	O

spot	O
which	O
will	O
surely	O

a	O

it	O

and	O
the	O

must	O
definitely	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O

Great	O

We	O
were	O

the	O

the	O

it	O

they	O

I	O

if	O
I	O
would	O
call	O
the	O

as	O
it	O

The	O

I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O

because	O
a	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
my	O

Their	O
sake	B-A
list	I-A
was	O

but	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
Purple	B-A
Haze	I-A
which	O
wasnt	O
listed	O
but	O
made	O
for	O
us	O
upon	O
request	O

The	O
tables	B-A
are	O
crammed	O

too	O
close	O
the	O
menu	B-A
is	O
typical	O
of	O
any	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O

is	O
simply	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
a	O
wonderful	O
experience	O
cant	O
wait	O
to	O
come	O
back	O

The	O

after	O
dining	O
at	O
BOG	O
over	O
twenty	O

now	O

My	O

both	O
ordered	O
the	O
Steak	B-A

Furthermore	O
the	O

the	O

The	O

about	O

you	O

The	O
ambiance	B-A
is	O
minimal	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
not	O
phenomenal	O
but	O
some	O
dishes	B-A
are	O

what	O
we	O

but	O
some	O

You	O

it	O

If	O
it	O

for	O
the	O

A	O
it	O
must	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
its	O
very	O
dark	O
and	O
original	O

Not	O
the	O

Everything	O
that	O

Our	O

a	O
few	O
weeks	O

You	O
are	O

for	O
the	O

I	O

Yes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
wait	B-A

area	I-A
and	O
the	O
seat	B-A
at	O
the	O

all	O

The	O
last	O
two	O
times	O
I	O
ordered	O
from	O
here	O
my	O
food	B-A
was	O
soo	O
spicy	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O
eat	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
spice	B-A
took	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
flavor	B-A
of	O
the	O
dish	B-A

The	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
are	O

Ive	O
been	O
here	O
so	O
many	O

the	O

The	O

and	O
Ive	O
never	O
been	O

We	O
figured	O
we	O
never	O
had	O
Argentinian	B-A
Pizza	I-A
before	O
so	O
we	O
grabbed	O
our	O
lunch	B-A
there	O
sharing	O
a	O
large	O
Pelligrino	B-A
a	O
pizza	B-A
of	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
specials	O
one	O
was	O
goat	B-A
cheese	I-A
the	O
other	O
blue	B-A

and	O
both	O
were	O
excellent	O

Heartland	O
Brewery	O

a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O

cosmopolitan	I-A
are	O
excellent	O
and	O
will	O
have	O
you	O
tipsy	O
in	O
no	O
time	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
perfect	O

spot	I-A
for	O
Williamsburg	O
couples	O

The	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
here	O
is	O
only	O
soso	O

It	O
was	O
raining	O
and	O
we	O
figured	O
why	O
not	O

6	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	O
food	B-A
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	O
and	O
continually	O
refilled	O

Just	O
straight	O
up	O
cheap	O
good	O
food	B-A

Another	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
neighborhood	O

Seating	B-A
is	O
ok	O
even	O
though	O
sometimes	O
theres	O
alot	O
of	O
people	O

This	O
time	O
I	O
prefer	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
detail	O

Even	O
with	O
a	O
relatively	O
inexpensive	O
botle	B-A
of	I-A
wine	I-A
if	O
you	O
can	O
call	O
7000	O
inexpensive	O
the	O
cost	B-A
is	O
through	O
the	O
roof	O
for	O
better	O
than	O
average	O
fare	O

Service	B-A
was	O
slow	O
but	O
the	O
people	B-A
were	O
friendly	O

Steamed	O
fresh	O
so	O
brought	O
hot	O
hot	O
hot	O
to	O
your	O
table	O

The	O
steak	B-A
was	O
very	O
fatty	O
and	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
was	O
overpowering	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
tasty	O

My	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
literally	O
sitting	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
next	O
to	O
you	O

And	O
affordable	O

The	O
staff	B-A
makes	O
you	O
feel	O
at	O
home	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
is	O
WONDERFUL	O

i	O
actually	O
feel	O
like	O
i	O
should	O
keep	O
it	O
a	O
secret	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
alright	O
some	O
stuff	O
is	O
good	O
some	O
is	O
not	O
like	O
the	O
steak	B-A
dish	I-A
which	O
tends	O
to	O
be	O
dry	O

Not	O
only	O
would	O
I	O
not	O
recommend	O
Jimmys	O
restaurants	O
to	O
friends	O
I	O
would	O
strongly	O
suggest	O
they	O
go	O
anywhere	O
but	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
diverse	O
menu	B-A
so	O
its	O
something	O
for	O
everybody	O

Haru	O
on	O
Park	O
S	O
is	O
simply	O
disgusting	O

The	O
staff	B-A
was	O
too	O
busy	O
ordering	O
sushi	B-A
for	O
dinner	B-A
and	O
then	O
laying	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
eat	O
on	O
the	O
bar	B-A
to	O
even	O
bring	O
me	O
my	O
check	B-A

As	O
a	O
longtime	O
patron	O
of	O
Mamouns	O
I	O
always	O
figured	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
the	O
best	O
late	O
night	O
food	B-A
spot	I-A
in	O
the	O
city	O

I	O
drop	O
more	O
dollar	O
bills	O
here	O
than	O
your	O
uncle	O
after	O
a	O
weekend	O
at	O
Scores	O

The	O
bagel	B-A
was	O
huge	O

Go	O
there	O
to	O
relax	O
and	O
feel	O
like	O
your	O
somewhere	O
else	O

Get	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
of	O
gari	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-A
chai	B-A
and	O
the	O
chole	B-A
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-A
and	O
dhal	B-A
were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
surprise	O

Edible	O
but	O
really	O
a	O
ripoff	O
at	O
those	O
prices	B-A
given	O
whats	O
in	O
the	O
area	O

The	O
staff	B-A
has	O
been	O
nice	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
really	O
stressed	O
and	O
the	O
unisex	O
bathroom	B-A
needs	O
to	O
be	O
cleaned	O
more	O
often	O

I	O
am	O
French	O
and	O
I	O
really	O
felt	O
like	O
home	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
Casimir	O
over	O
5	O
times	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
there	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
good	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	O

Its	O
usually	O
packed	O
for	O
good	O
reason	O
esp	O

Service	B-A
friendly	O
and	O
attentive	O

I	O
love	O
going	O
there	O

I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
OG	O
more	O
highly	O
if	O
I	O
tried	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
yourself	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
we	O
ate	O
on	O
our	O
first	O
trip	O
to	O
New	O

and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
the	O

as	O
we	O

out	O
of	O

on	O
our	O

we	O
ASKED	O
for	O
a	O
slightly	O

they	O
left	O
us	O
awkardly	O

The	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

the	O
BEST	O
service	B-A

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
attentive	O
without	O
being	O
overbearing	O
and	O
each	O

we	O
tried	O

from	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
cod	B-A
with	I-A
pineapple	I-A
tempura	I-A

But	O
trust	O
me	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
worth	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
tourists	O
or	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
never	O
dined	O
in	O
Bay	O
Ridge	O

THe	O
perfect	O
spot	O

The	O
only	O
weird	O
thing	O
was	O
if	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
bottle	B-A
the	O
waitress	B-A
would	O
have	O
simply	O
multiplied	O
the	O
glass	O
price	B-A
X4	O
which	O
makes	O
no	O
sense	O
whatsoever	O

They	O
sell	O
special	O

everything	O

a	O

DO	O
not	O
try	O
unless	O
youre	O
just	O
going	O
there	O
to	O

out	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

no	O
sense	O
of	O

They	O
never	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
refill	O
our	O

again	O

The	O
place	B-A
is	O
small	O
and	O
intimate	O
and	O
you	O
may	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
crowded	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
excellent	O
and	O
its	O
great	O
for	O
friends	O
out	O
a	O
romantic	O

The	O

and	O
the	O

was	O
delicious	O

Service	B-A

I	O

my	O

her	O
birthday	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
relaxing	O
really	O
good	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
portions	B-A
if	O
the	O
qualities	B-A
were	O
good	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not	O

Theyre	O
rude	O
at	O

and	O
not	O

Im	O

but	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
a	O

slow	O

Spreads	B-A

When	O

as	O
we	O

We	O

a	O

you	O
and	O
they	O
kept	O
the	O

flowing	O
the	O
whole	O
time	O

And	O
their	O
prices	B-A
are	O
very	O
high	O
they	O
actually	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
get	O
away	O
with	O
charging	O
such	O
prices	B-A
for	O
such	O
terrible	O

Theyre	O

The	O

the	O
food	B-A
was	O
excellent	O
but	O
the	O
entire	O

The	O
service	B-A
is	O
good	O
and	O
the	O

whether	O

Just	O

with	O

the	O

If	O

The	O

and	O
the	O

Just	O
wish	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
ate	O

it	O

only	O
of	O

thai	I-A
and	O
tom	B-A
yum	I-A

but	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
what	O
made	O
the	O
place	O
so	O
special	O

Good	O
food	B-A
at	O
the	O

if	O

top	O

and	O
fantastic	O
service	B-A

You	O
cant	O
say	O
its	O
cheap	O
because	O

is	O
cheaper	O
in	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
there	O
34	O

and	O
the	O

I	O
wasnt	O
thrilled	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
wait	B-A
on	O

for	O
thirty	O
minutes	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
thats	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
a	O
popular	O
place	O

great	O

For	O

I	O
thought	O
Tuscan	B-A
cuisine	I-A
was	O
the	O

but	O
Salvatore	O
converted	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
hearty	O
Neapolitan	B-A
fare	I-A
on	O
my	O
first	O
visit	O

Plus	O
when	O

up	O

the	O

The	O

our	O
Secret	O

We	O
were	O

From	O
the	O

we	O
walked	O

they	O
were	O
more	O
than	O

even	O
though	O
the	O

was	O
packed	O

It	O
is	O
LOUD	O

very	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
definitely	O
good	O
but	O
I	O

If	O
you	O

for	O
a	O

it	O
provides	O
and	O
intimate	O
setting	B-A
and	O
nice	O

The	O

great	O
also	O

they	O
did	O
give	O
a	O
15	O
discount	B-A
at	O
the	O
end	O
wasnt	O
enough	O
as	O
they	O
knew	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
horrible	O

Just	O
because	O
its	O
cheap	O
does	O
NOT	O
mean	O
the	O
portions	B-A
are	O
small	O
or	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
nasty	O
IT	O
IS	O
GREAT	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
was	O
great	O

And	O
everytime	O
I	O
go	O
theres	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
drunk	O
idiots	O
making	O
a	O
scene	O
out	O
front	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
Edamame	B-A
pureed	I-A
before	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
couldve	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
salt	O

however	O
its	O
the	O
service	B-A
that	O
leaves	O
a	O
bad	O
taste	O
in	O
my	O
mouth	O

When	O
we	O
notified	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
didnt	O
mention	O
the	O
specials	B-A
he	O
didnt	O
apologize	O
but	O
let	O
us	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
decision	O
regardless	O

The	O
price	B-A
was	O
extremely	O
reasonable	O
for	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
and	O
food	B-A
we	O
ate	O

Dont	O
dine	O
at	O
Tamarind	O
for	O
the	O
vegetarian	B-A
dishes	I-A
they	O
are	O
simply	O
not	O
up	O
to	O
par	O
with	O
the	O
nonveg	B-A
selections	I-A

Kenny	O
the	O
owner	B-A
is	O
always	O
there	O
and	O
he	O
treats	O
my	O
family	O
like	O
we	O
are	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
family	O

They	O
need	O
a	O
kick	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
but	O
until	O
then	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
is	O
pretty	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
is	O
consistent	O

Ive	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
times	O
during	O
lunch	B-A
but	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
definitely	O
worth	O
the	O
wait	B-A

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
above	O
average	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
return	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
they	O
operate	O
with	O
four	O
or	O
less	O
dinners	B-A

Judging	O
from	O
previous	O
posts	O
this	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
longer	O

Delicious	O
food	B-A
excellent	O

and	O
a	O

make	O
this	O
a	O
great	O
choice	O
for	O
dinner	B-A
and	O
the	O
599	O
lunch	B-A
buffet	I-A
makes	O
it	O
an	O
even	O
better	O
choice	O
for	O
lunch	B-A

For	O
appetizers	B-A
I	O
recommend	O
the	O
shrimp	B-A
fritters	I-A
and	O
dumplings	B-A

And	O
cheap	O

Such	O
nice	O
people	B-A
working	O
here	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
review	O
the	O
food	B-A

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
dark	O
and	O
not	O
very	O

I	O

for	O
a	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
true	O
gem	O
of	O
the	O

Its	O
location	B-A
is	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
Hutner	O
College	O
is	O
near	O
and	O
their	O
prices	B-A
are	O
very	O
reasonable	O
makes	O

go	O
back	O
to	O

again	O
and	O
again	O

However	O
I	O
think	O
Jeckll	O
and	O
Hydes	O
t	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
is	O
fun	O
to	O
do	O
once	O

They	O
treat	O
me	O
like	O
family	O
morning	O
and	O
night	O

A	O
wonderful	O
place	B-A

Please	O
take	O
my	O
advice	O
go	O
and	O
try	O
this	O
place	O

Service	B-A
was	O
on	O
par	O
but	O
not	O
wonderful	O

for	O
my	O
birthday	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
excellent	O

Deliveries	B-A
often	O
take	O
up	O
to	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
the	O
prices	B-A
are	O
higher	O
than	O
most	O
other	O
pizzerias	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
Amma	O
after	O
a	O

recommended	O
it	O

Im	O
just	O
reading	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
reviews	O
and	O
its	O
nonsense	O
that	O
people	O
are	O
reviewing	O
some	O
places	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
loud	O

Kind	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
but	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
busy	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
fit	O
a	O
group	O
or	O
kids	O

Maybe	O
tomorrow	O

We	O
also	O
ordered	O
two	O
hot	B-A
dogs	I-A
thinking	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
pretty	O
good	O
since	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
whole	O
section	O
on	O
the	O

to	O
them	O

please	O

I	O
suspect	O
this	O

is	O
what	O
Raos	O
would	O
be	O
if	O
it	O
hadnt	O
turned	O
exclusive	O

The	O

were	O
served	B-A
while	O

I	O

and	O
no	O
other	O
table	B-A
was	O

The	O

the	O
UES	O

all	O
over	O
the	O
Kensington	O
neighborhood	O
Ive	O
found	O
little	O
toninos	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
totally	O
overrated	O

then	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
dinosaur	B-A
rolls	I-A
and	O
white	B-A
tuna	I-A
sashimi	I-A

1015	O

Interior	O
was	O
so	O
so	O

Im	O
partial	O
to	O
the	O
Gnocchi	B-A

I	O
guess	O
the	O
way	O
my	O
friends	O
and	O
I	O
described	O
it	O
was	O
The	O
French	O
Colonies	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
me	O
in	O
at	O
6	O
after	O
i	O
called	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
my	O

for	O
a	O
friday	O

reservation	B-A
and	O
told	O
me	O
theyd	O
treat	O
us	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
occasion	O

Boy	O
was	O
I	O
wrong	O

I	O
visit	O
New	O
Green	O
Bo	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
money	O
or	O
when	O
I	O
am	O
broke	O

Note	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
serve	O
beer	B-A
you	O
must	O
bring	O
your	O
own	O

We	O
ate	O
outside	O
at	O
Harus	O
Sake	O
bar	B-A
because	O
Harus	O
restaurant	O
next	O
door	O
was	O
overflowing	O

When	O
we	O
walked	O
in	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
200	O
years	O

Ahhh	O

Better	O
than	O
the	O
bagel	O
shop	O
on	O
the	O
corner	O
but	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
way	O
for	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O

it	O
helps	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
order	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
typical	O
shortorder	O
dinner	O
type	O

We	O
shared	O
a	O
bottle	B-A
of	I-A
sake	I-A
an	O
order	O
of	O
edamames	B-A
and	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
plate	I-A
while	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
sashimi	B-A

I	O
cant	O
believe	O
people	O
complain	O
about	O
no	O
cheese	B-A
sticks	I-A

But	O
that	O
is	O
highly	O
forgivable	O

From	O
the	O
appetizers	B-A
we	O
ate	O
the	O
dim	B-A
sum	I-A
and	O
other	O
variety	O
of	O
foods	B-A
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
criticize	O
the	O
food	B-A

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
600	O
PM	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
practically	O
empty	O

Each	O
table	B-A
has	O
a	O
pot	B-A
of	I-A
boiling	I-A
water	I-A
sunken	O
into	O
its	O
surface	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
platters	O
of	O
thin	O

meats	B-A
various	O
