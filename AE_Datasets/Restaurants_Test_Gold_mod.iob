Did	O
I	O

that	O
the	O

this	O

The	O

of	I-A
the	I-A

that	O
came	O
out	O
were	O
mediocre	O

the	O
two	O

looked	O
like	O
they	O

I	O

it	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	O
than	O
other	O

I	O

the	O
secret	O
was	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
night	O
and	O
everything	O
was	O
great	O

The	O

Also	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
menu	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
clearly	O

that	O

I	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
manager	B-A
but	O
the	O
intensity	O
of	O

from	O
them	O
just	O
went	O
up	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
milkshakes	B-A
are	O
even	O
better	O

Stay	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
continued	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
over	O
the	O

While	O
it	O

noisy	O
the	O
drinks	B-A
were	O
fantastic	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
superb	O

One	O
caveat	O
Some	O
of	O
the	O
curried	B-A
casseroles	I-A
can	O
be	O
a	O
trifle	O
harsh	O

I	O

The	O

a	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
resteraunt	O
on	O
my	O
way	O
home	O
from	O
the	O
subway	O

The	O
Management	B-A
was	O
less	O
than	O
accomodating	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
is	O
also	O
more	O
laidback	O
and	O
relaxed	O

the	O
teas	B-A
are	O
great	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
sweets	B-A
are	O
homemade	O

mojitos	B-A
and	O
the	O

The	O

and	O
imaginative	O

The	O
staff	B-A
is	O
very	O
sharp	O
and	O
they	O
look	O
good	O
too	O

The	O
worst	O
though	O
was	O
the	O
taste	B-A

They	O
were	O
dry	O
stale	O
and	O
pretty	O
flavorless	O

The	O
fajita	B-A
we	O
tried	O
was	O
tasteless	O
and	O
burned	O
and	O
the	O
mole	B-A
sauce	I-A
was	O
way	O
too	O
sweet	O

Stay	O
with	O
the	O
roasted	B-A

the	O
drinks	B-A
are	O
really	O
good	O

The	O
steak	B-A
melted	O
in	O
my	O
mouth	O

The	O
food	B-A
did	O
take	O
a	O
few	O
extra	O
minutes	O
to	O
come	O
but	O
the	O
cute	O
waiters	B-A
jokes	O
and	O
friendliness	O
made	O
up	O
for	O
it	O

Most	O
importantly	O
it	O
is	O
reasonably	O
priced	B-A

The	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
food	I-A
is	O
excellent	O
Im	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
having	O
much	O
choice	O
at	O
restaurants	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
is	O
great	O

Only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
skip	O
the	O
dessert	B-A
it	O
was	O
overpriced	O
and	O
fell	O
short	O
on	O
taste	B-A

Food	B-A
was	O
decent	O
but	O
not	O
great	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
why	O
this	O
restaurant	O
is	O
so	O
often	O
overlooked	O

From	O
the	O
moment	O
you	O
walk	O
in	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
youre	O
in	O
the	O
perfect	O
place	O

i	O
dont	O
know	O
what	O
some	O
people	O
who	O
rave	O
about	O
this	O
hot	B-A
dog	I-A
are	O
talking	O
about	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
hidden	O
delight	O
complete	O
with	O
a	O
quaint	O
bar	B-A
and	O
good	O
food	B-A

I	O
find	O
that	O
most	O
Kosher	O
restaurants	O
are	O
average	O
to	O
good	O
but	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
best	O
Ive	O
eaten	O
so	O
far	O

The	O
waiters	B-A
ALWAYS	O
look	O
angry	O
and	O
even	O
ignore	O
their	O
hightipping	O
regulars	O

the	O
atmosphere	B-A
is	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
a	O
welcome	O
escape	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
SI	O
mall	O

Yes	O
theyre	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
expensive	O
then	O
typical	O
but	O
then	O
again	O
so	O
is	O
their	O
food	B-A

Not	O
terrible	O
but	O
not	O
the	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
reviews	O
of	O
2002	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
wraps	B-A
burgers	B-A
and	O
salads	B-A
were	O
all	O
fresh	O
tasty	O
and	O
the	O
mango	B-A
margareta	I-A
at	O
9	O
was	O
WELL	O
WORTH	O
the	O
money	O

It	O
was	O
delicious	O
and	O
large	O

Anywhere	O
else	O
the	O
prices	B-A
would	O
be	O
3x	O
as	O
high	O

The	O
service	B-A
we	O
experienced	O
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
good	O

Our	O
waiter	B-A
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
shame	O
that	O
he	O
didnt	O
have	O
a	O
supportive	O
staff	B-A
to	O
work	O
with	O

The	O
folding	B-A

As	O
we	O

I	O
watched	O
3	O

groups	O
of	O

how	O

they	O
also	O
were	O

An	O
excellent	O
choice	O
in	O
midtown	O

Service	B-A
was	O
among	O
the	O

I	O
have	O

it	O

not	O
the	O

and	O
definately	O
not	O
worth	O
standing	O
outside	O

I	O

also	O
the	O

The	O

great	O
about	O
being	O
outdoors	B-A
in	O
great	O

enjoying	O
a	O

that	O
makes	O

of	O
the	O

this	O
the	O

at	O

The	O

is	O
a	O
little	O
plain	O
but	O
its	O
difficult	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
exciting	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suggest	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
reason	O
not	O
to	O

After	O
dinner	B-A
I	O
heard	O
music	B-A
playing	O
and	O
discovered	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
lounge	B-A
downstairs	O

But	O
now	O
that	O
its	O
under	O
new	O

and	O
has	O

it	O
looks	O

and	O
the	O

Now	O
we	O
moved	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
every	O
visit	O
to	O
NYC	O
includes	O
a	O
stop	O
here	O

Two	O
complaints	O
their	O
appetizer	B-A

stinks	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
mozzarella	B-A
sticks	I-A
on	O
the	O
menu	B-A

I	O
dont	O
remember	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
was	O
memorable	O

It	O
is	O
bland	O
and	O
nothing	O
extrodinary	O

I	O
was	O
especially	O
impressed	O
during	O
the	O
bday	O
party	O
when	O
the	O
waitstaff	B-A
went	O
above	O
and	O
beyond	O
in	O
helping	O
me	O
decorate	O
and	O
bring	O
out	O
a	O

well	O
as	O
offering	O
prompt	O
and	O
friendly	O
service	B-A
to	O
a	O
15	O

The	O
chicken	B-A

falafel	I-A
platters	I-A
were	O
nondescript	O
combinations	O
with	O
fresh	B-A

Every	O
time	O
I	O
visit	O
NYC	O
I	O
come	O
here	O

Ive	O
been	O
coming	O
here	O
regularly	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
about	O
2	O
years	O
ago	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
takes	O
you	O
to	O
that	O
place	O
the	O
place	O
many	O
dream	O
of	O

several	O
times	O
and	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
bad	O
manners	O
knowing	O
that	O
their	O
job	O
isnt	O
easy	O

The	O
service	B-A
is	O
great	O
maybe	O
even	O
borderline	O
nagging	O
but	O
at	O
least	O
you	O
get	O
attention	O
the	O
desserts	B-A
are	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
coffee	B-A
is	O
so	O
very	O
good	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
next	O
to	O
a	O
couple	O
whose	O
kitchen	O
was	O
being	O
renovated	O
and	O
we	O
agreed	O
since	O
were	O
all	O
foodies	O
who	O
eat	O
out	O
a	O
lot	O
that	O
this	O
wasnt	O
a	O

They	O
are	O

on	O
Focacchia	B-A

and	O
are	O
to	O

for	O

While	O
the	O

are	O
a	O
little	O
big	O
for	O
me	O
the	O
fresh	B-A
juices	I-A
are	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
had	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
just	O
OKAY	O
and	O
its	O
almost	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
unless	O
youre	O
getting	O
the	O
pialla	B-A
which	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
dish	B-A
thats	O
really	O
good	O

The	O
guac	B-A
is	O
fresh	O
yet	O
lacking	O
flavor	B-A
we	O
like	O
to	O
add	O
our	O
fresh	B-A
salsa	I-A
into	O
it	O

The	O
new	B-A

creative	O
itemsthey	O
were	O
smart	O
enough	O
to	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
they	O
raised	O
the	O
prices	B-A
the	O
staff	B-A
is	O
friendly	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
must	O

No	O
