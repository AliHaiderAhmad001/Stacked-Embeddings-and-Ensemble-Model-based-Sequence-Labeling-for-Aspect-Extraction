Judging	O
from	O
previous	O
posts	O
this	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
place	B-A
but	O
not	O
any	O
longer	O

We	O
there	O
were	O
four	O
of	O
us	O
arrived	O
at	O
noon	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
empty	O
and	O
the	O
staff	B-A
acted	O
like	O
we	O
were	O
imposing	O
on	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
rude	O

They	O
never	O
brought	O
us	O
complimentary	O
noodles	O
ignored	O
repeated	O
requests	O
for	O
sugar	O
and	O
threw	O
our	O
dishes	O
on	O
the	O
table	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
lousy	O
too	O
sweet	O
or	O
too	O
salty	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
tiny	O

After	O
all	O
that	O
they	O
complained	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
the	O
small	O
tip	O

Avoid	O
this	O
place	B-A

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
Saul	O
many	O
times	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
always	O
consistently	O
outrageously	O
good	O

Saul	B-A
is	O
the	O
best	O
restaurant	O
on	O
Smith	O
Street	O
and	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O

The	O
duck	B-A
confit	I-A
is	O
always	O
amazing	O
and	O
the	O
foie	B-A
gras	I-A
terrine	I-A
with	I-A
figs	I-A
was	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world	O

The	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
is	O
interesting	O
and	O
has	O
many	O
good	O
values	O

For	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
cannot	O
eat	O
this	O
well	O
in	O
Manhattan	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
disappointed	O
with	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A

Ive	O
asked	O
a	O
cart	B-A
attendant	I-A
for	O
a	O
lotus	O
leaf	O
wrapped	O
rice	O
and	O
she	O
replied	O
back	O
rice	O
and	O
just	O
walked	O
away	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
her	O
three	O
times	O
before	O
she	O
finally	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
the	O
dish	O
Ive	O
requested	O

Food	B-A
was	O
okay	O
nothing	O
great	O

Chow	B-A
fun	I-A
was	O
dry	O
pork	B-A
shu	I-A
mai	I-A
was	O
more	O
than	O
usually	O
greasy	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
share	O
a	O
table	O
with	O
loud	O
and	O
rude	O
family	O

Iwe	O
will	O
never	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
this	O
place	B-A
again	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
3	O
day	O
oyster	O
binge	O
with	O
Fish	B-A
bringing	O
up	O
the	O
closing	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
glad	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
place	O
it	O
O	O
trip	O
ended	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
great	O

Service	B-A
was	O
devine	O
oysters	B-A
where	O
a	O
sensual	O
as	O
they	O
come	O
and	O
the	O
price	O
cant	O
be	O
beat	O

You	O
cant	O
go	O
wrong	O
here	O

Every	O
time	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
point	O
to	O
visit	O
Restaurant	B-A
Saul	I-A
on	O
Smith	O
Street	O

Everything	O
is	O
always	O
cooked	O
to	O
perfection	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
excellent	O
the	O
decor	B-A
cool	O
and	O
understated	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
duck	B-A
breast	I-A
special	I-A
on	O
my	O
last	O
visit	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible	O

Cant	O
wait	O
wait	O
for	O
my	O
next	O
visit	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
eyes	O
on	O
this	O
place	O
promising	O
myself	O
I	O
will	O
one	O
day	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O

And	O
I	O
hate	O
to	O
say	O
this	O
but	O
I	O
doubt	O
Ill	O
ever	O
go	O
back	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
very	O
averagethe	O
Thai	B-A
fusion	I-A
stuff	I-A
is	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
sweet	O
every	O
thing	O
they	O
serve	O
is	O
too	O
sweet	O
here	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	O
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-A
Chicken	I-A
special	I-A
with	I-A
Edamame	I-A
Puree	I-A

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
Edamame	B-A
pureed	I-A
before	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
couldve	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
salt	O

Anyways	O
if	O
youre	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
to	O
eat	O
good	O
food	O
I	O
wouldnt	O
waste	O
my	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
something	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari	O

The	O
decor	B-A
is	O
night	O
thobut	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O
vent	B-A
in	O
the	O
ceilingits	O
quite	O
unappetizing	O
and	O
kills	O
your	O
effort	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
place	B-A
look	O
sleek	O
and	O
modern	O

We	O
ate	O
outside	O
at	O
Harus	O
Sake	O
bar	O
because	O
Harus	O
restaurant	O
next	O
door	O
was	O
overflowing	O

Whats	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
two	O

Their	O
sake	B-A
list	I-A
was	O
extensive	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
looking	O
for	O
Purple	O
Haze	O
which	O
wasnt	O
listed	O
but	O
made	O
for	O
us	O
upon	O
request	O

The	O
spicy	B-A
tuna	I-A
roll	I-A
was	O
unusually	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
rock	B-A
shrimp	I-A
tempura	I-A
was	O
awesome	O
great	O
appetizer	O
to	O
share	O

We	O
went	O
around	O
930	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
died	O
down	O
a	O
bit	O
by	O
then	O
so	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
great	O

we	O

Service	B-A

Dont	O

this	O
place	B-A
prima	O

you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
to	O
believe	O
it	O
a	O

the	O

its	O
the	O
service	B-A
that	O
leaves	O
a	O
bad	O
taste	O
in	O
my	O

i	O
happen	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
policy	O
that	O
goes	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
selfrespect	O
which	O
includes	O
not	O
letting	O
a	O

intimidate	O
me	O

make	O
me	O
feel	O
bad	O
asking	O

the	O

i	O

the	O
last	O

i	O

it	O

hmmm	O

This	O
place	B-A
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
japanese	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
york	O
area	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
experience	O

Food	B-A
is	O
great	O

Service	B-A
is	O
top	O
notch	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
again	O

I	O
tend	O
to	O
judge	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
by	O
its	O
sea	B-A
urchin	I-A
which	O
was	O
heavenly	O
at	O
sushi	O
rose	O

It	O
melted	O
in	O
my	O
little	O
mouth	O
and	O
the	O
perfect	O
consistencynot	O
too	O
fishy	O
creamy	O
and	O
slightly	O
buttery	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
seemed	O
pretty	O
fresh	O
and	O
was	O
adequately	O
proportioned	O

The	O
rice	B-A
to	I-A
fish	I-A
ration	I-A
was	O
also	O
goodthey	O
didnt	O
try	O
to	O
overpack	O
the	O
rice	O

We	O
took	O
advanatage	O
of	O
the	O
half	B-A
price	I-A
sushi	I-A
deal	I-A
on	O
saturday	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
it	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
this	O
restaurant	O
with	O
a	O
woman	O
that	O
I	O
met	O
recently	O

She	O
lives	O
nearby	O
but	O
had	O
never	O
gone	O
to	O
this	O
establishment	O
thinking	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
touristy	O

Surprisingly	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
further	O
from	O
the	O
truth	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
this	O
place	O
attracted	O
a	O
well	O
dressed	O
with	O
it	O
NY	O
crowd	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
impecable	O

Im	O
going	O
back	O

Having	O
hunted	O
around	O
for	O
a	O
quiet	O
romantic	O
yet	O
not	O
hideously	O
expensive	O
restaurant	O
I	O
stumbled	O
across	O
reviews	O
for	O
La	O
Lanterna	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
shot	O

Quite	O
simply	O
its	O
like	O
stepping	O
out	O
of	O
Manhattan	O
and	O
into	O
a	O
haven	O
of	O
tranquility	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
attentive	O
yet	O
unimposing	O
the	O
food	O
was	O
far	O
better	O
than	O
many	O
notorious	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Midtown	O
and	O
the	O
wine	O
list	O
is	O
extensive	O
and	O
well	O
priced	O

The	O
Prix	B-A
Fixe	I-A
menu	I-A
is	O
worth	O
every	O
penny	O
and	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
both	O
in	O
quantity	O
AND	O
quality	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
and	O
heartily	O
recommend	O
it	O

Ive	O
had	O
the	O
lunch	O
buffet	O
at	O
Chennai	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
times	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O

It	O
is	O
terrific	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
value	O

6	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
tasty	O
food	B-A
all	O
of	O
it	O
fresh	O
and	O
continually	O
refilled	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
but	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
dishes	B-A
were	O
great	O

Frankly	O
when	O
you	O
compare	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
here	O
for	O
lunch	O
versus	O
McDs	O
or	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
sandwich	O
shops	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
comparison	O

Go	O
hungry	O
and	O
enjoy	O

The	O
food	B-A
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-A
chai	B-A
and	O
the	O
chole	B-A
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-A
and	O
dhal	B-A
were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing	O

The	O
service	B-A
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
sometimes	O
theyre	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O

The	O
kitchen	B-A
however	O
is	O
almost	O
always	O
slow	O

Also	O
specify	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
your	O
food	B-A
spicy	O
its	O
rather	O
bland	O
if	O
you	O
dont	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O
conversation	O
so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	O
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O

Just	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
girlfriends	O
23rd	O
bday	O

If	O
youve	O
ever	O
been	O
along	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
Weehawken	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
view	B-A
the	O
chart	O
house	O
has	O
to	O
offer	O

Add	O
to	O
that	O
great	O
service	B-A
and	O
great	O
food	B-A
at	O
a	O
reasonable	O
price	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
yourself	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
evening	O

The	O
lava	B-A
cake	I-A
dessert	I-A
was	O
incredible	O
and	O
I	O
recommend	O
it	O

Once	O
you	O
step	O
into	O
Cosette	B-A
youre	O
miraculously	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
offthebeaten	O
path	O
Parisian	O
bistro	O

This	O
tiny	O
restaurant	B-A
is	O
as	O
cozy	O
as	O
it	O
gets	O
with	O
that	O
certain	O
Parisian	O
flair	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
average	O
to	O
aboveaverage	O
the	O
French	B-A
Onion	I-A
soup	I-A
filling	O
yet	O
not	O
overly	O
impressive	O
and	O
the	O
desserts	B-A
not	O
brilliant	O
in	O
any	O
way	O

However	O
go	O
for	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
and	O
consider	O
the	O
food	B-A
just	O
a	O
companion	O
for	O
a	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
world	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
eaten	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant	O
however	O
upon	O
reading	O
the	O
reviews	O
I	O
got	O
take	O
out	O
last	O
week	O

IT	O
WAS	O
HORRIBLE	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
was	O
delivered	O
cold	O
and	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
wasnt	O
even	O
fully	O
melted	O

It	O
looked	O
like	O
shredded	O
cheese	O
partly	O
done	O
still	O
in	O
strips	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
at	O
many	O
pizza	O
places	O
around	O
NYC	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
hands	O
down	O
the	O
worst	O

This	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
overrated	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
overpriced	O
and	O
soggy	O

Yes	O
they	O
use	O
fancy	O
ingredients	B-A
but	O
even	O
fancy	O
ingredients	O
dont	O
make	O
for	O
good	O
pizza	B-A
unless	O
someone	O
knows	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
crust	B-A
right	O

A	O
big	O
disappointment	O
all	O
around	O

I	O
think	O
Ive	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-A
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow	O

The	O
seafood	B-A
is	O
amazing	O
theres	O
a	O
good	O
wine	B-A
list	I-A
and	O
the	O
everchanging	O
menu	B-A
always	O
offers	O
some	O
great	O
surprises	O

The	O
combination	O
of	O
superfresh	O
ingredients	B-A
in	O
the	O
dishes	O
are	O
unusual	O
but	O
really	O
delicious	O

Worth	O
the	O
trip	O
from	O
Manhattan	O

Was	O
there	O
Friday	O
night	O

Best	O
Pastrami	B-A
I	O
ever	O
had	O
and	O
great	O
portion	B-A
without	O
being	O
ridiculous	O

And	O
Ive	O
been	O
to	O
many	O
NYC	O
delis	O

My	O
wife	O
had	O
the	O
fried	B-A
shrimp	I-A
which	O
are	O
huge	O
and	O
loved	O
it	O

Price	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
Jersey	O
deli	O
but	O
way	O
better	O

As	O
a	O
Japanese	O
native	O
Ive	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
Tristate	O
area	O
for	O
over	O
8	O
years	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
so	O
amazed	O
at	O
this	O
place	B-A

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
the	O
most	O
Japanese	O
it	O
can	O
ever	O
get	O

The	O
signs	B-A
the	O

menus	I-A
food	B-A
and	O
even	O
all	O
the	O
waitstaff	B-A
are	O
ALL	O
TOTALLY	O
Japanese	O

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
worth	O
an	O
onehour	O
drive	O

I	O
am	O
so	O
coming	O

the	O

Im	O
partial	O
to	O
the	O
Gnocchi	B-A

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
incredibly	O
tiny	O

They	O
refuse	O
to	O
seat	O
parties	O
of	O
3	O
or	O
more	O
on	O
weekends	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
is	O
rude	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
being	O
offensive	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
bland	O
oily	O

I	O
just	O
dont	O
understand	O
all	O
the	O

We	O

to	O
have	O
a	O
short	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O

When	O

there	O
are	O
always	O
so	O

you	O
forget	O
you	O
are	O

as	O
you	O

This	O
is	O

go	O
to	O

The	O

I	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
I	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
reviews	O
I	O
read	O

Sauce	B-A
was	O
watery	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
didnt	O
have	O

flavor	O

If	O
you	O
like	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
the	O
value	O
you	O
get	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
Chinatown	O
restaurants	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
you	O

I	O
dont	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
again	O

This	O

I	O
suppose	O
thats	O
how	O
they	O

the	O

Its	O
all	O
about	O
the	O

a	O
long	O
time	O
to	O

we	O
were	O
tired	O

when	O
we	O

then	O
we	O
ordered	O
a	O
dinosaur	O

for	O
more	O

The	O
restaurant	B-A

The	O

I	O

this	O
place	B-A

You	O

not	O
be	O
disapointed	O
at	O
all	O

Our	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
New	O
York	O
Bagel	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
dissappointed	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
bit	O
by	O
this	O
little	O
gem	O

The	O
bagel	B-A
was	O
huge	O

They	O
were	O
served	O
warm	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
soft	O
fluffy	O
interior	O

The	O
workers	O
there	O
also	O
absolutely	O
load	O
the	O
bagel	B-A
with	O
cream	O
cheese	O
gets	O
a	O
little	O
messy	O

I	O
loved	O
it	O
and	O
would	O
HIGHLY	O
RECOMMEND	O

This	O
was	O
my	O
frist	O
time	O
at	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
how	O
delicous	O
the	O
food	B-A
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O

When	O
I	O
called	O
this	O

I	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O

at	O
12	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
along	O
with	O
four	O
other	O
guests	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
lobster	B-A

not	O
to	O
much	O
mayo	O
you	O
can	O
tell	O
it	O
was	O

Cafe	O
St	O
Barts	O
for	O
their	O

the	O
ambience	B-A
and	O
wonderful	O
service	B-A

All	O
the	O

absolutely	O
professional	O

I	O
sometimes	O
see	O
the	O
waiters	O
dont	O
have	O
enough	O
knowledge	O
of	O
their	O
dishes	O

But	O
they	O
do	O

that	O
is	O
A	O
MUST	O
but	O
not	O
every	O
restaurant	O
can	O
do	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
large	O
party	O
I	O

to	O
make	O
reservation	O
BASEMENT	O

Theres	O
nice	O

enough	O
for	O

This	O
restaurant	B-A
was	O
way	O
overhyped	O

My	O
chow	B-A

The	O
scallion	B-A
pancakes	I-A
and	O
fried	B-A
dumplings	I-A
were	O
nothing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
good	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A

Its	O
boring	O

pretty	O
below	O

the	O

the	O

cute	O
and	O
quaint	O
good	O
for	O

although	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
on	O

Salads	B-A

the	O

2	O
extra	O
to	O

Yes	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O

I	O

We	O

The	O
place	O
is	O
a	O
BISTRO	O
which	O
means	O
simple	O
dishes	B-A
and	O
wine	B-A
served	O
efficiently	O
in	O
a	O

atmosphere	B-A

And	O
where	O

where	O

You	O
are	O
not	O
eating	O
haut	O

with	O

but	O
Cassuolet	O

And	O
evaluated	O
on	O
those	O

Pastis	B-A
is	O

wonderful	O

Right	O
off	O
the	O
L	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
nice	O
cozy	O
place	B-A
with	O
good	O
pizza	B-A

Mine	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
burnt	O
but	O
still	O
delicious	O
with	O
goat	O
cheese	O
and	O
panchetta	O
raddichio	B-A
was	O
kind	O
of	O
bitter	O
though	O

My	O
friend	O
got	O
the	O
mushroom	B-A
pizza	I-A
which	O
tasted	O
better	O

The	O
sangria	B-A
was	O
pretty	O
tasty	O
and	O
good	O
on	O
a	O
hot	O
muggy	O
day	O

Kind	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
place	B-A
but	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
too	O
busy	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
fit	O
a	O
group	O
or	O
kids	O

Overall	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
and	O
go	O
back	O
again	O

Coming	O
from	O
Boston	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
like	O
Emmas	O
Pizza	O
in	O
Kendall	O
Square	O
in	O
Cambridge	O
although	O
they	O
have	O
more	O
funky	O
toppings	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
Bombay	B-A
beer	I-A
which	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O
two	O

For	O
dinner	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
chicken	O
tikkamasala	O
and	O
some	O
garlic	O
naan	O

MMmmm	O
it	O
was	O
delicious	O

Service	B-A
was	O
slow	O
but	O
the	O
people	B-A
were	O
friendly	O

Its	O
a	O
nice	O
place	B-A
to	O
relax	O
and	O
have	O
conversation	O

I	O
cant	O
wait	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

We	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
Chelsea	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
and	O
have	O
never	O
noticed	O
this	O
restaurant	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
authentic	O
Italian	O
delicious	O

Pizza	B-A
is	O
terrific	O
as	O
is	O
homemade	B-A
pasta	I-A

Ambience	B-A
is	O
delightful	O
service	B-A
impeccable	O

Im	O
still	O
mad	O
that	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
lousy	O
food	B-A

The	O
hanger	B-A
steak	I-A
was	O
like	O
rubber	O
and	O
the	O
tuna	B-A
was	O
flavorless	O
not	O
to	O
mention	O
it	O
tasted	O
like	O
it	O
had	O
just	O
been	O
thawed	O

Service	B-A
was	O
also	O
horrible	O
and	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
is	O
not	O
that	O
great	O

DO	O
not	O
try	O
unless	O
youre	O
just	O
going	O
there	O
to	O
hang	O
out	O
like	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
hipsters	O
who	O
apparently	O
have	O
no	O
sense	O
of	O
taste	O

I	O
go	O
and	O
eat	O
out	O
at	O
many	O
different	O
restaurants	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
place	B-A
you	O
have	O
go	O
and	O
try	O

This	O
is	O
my	O
first	O
time	O
writing	O
a	O
review	O
for	O
a	O
restaurant	O
because	O
the	O
food	B-A
and	O
service	B-A
was	O
excellent	O

The	O
filet	B-A
mignon	I-A
dish	I-A
was	O
superb	O

I	O
would	O
defiantly	O
come	O
back	O
here	O
again	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
top	O
choices	O

Its	O
a	O
small	O
cute	O
restaurant	B-A

I	O
absolutely	O
love	O
this	O
place	B-A

From	O
the	O
street	O
it	O
looks	O
very	O
hidden	O
and	O
is	O
actually	O
an	O
old	O
warehouse	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
ambience	B-A
its	O
very	O
dark	O
and	O
original	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
friends	O
birthday	O
and	O
keep	O
coming	O
back	O
ever	O
since	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
is	O
amazing	O

And	O
amazingly	O
cheap	O

Big	O
thumbs	O
up	O

Very	O
affordable	O
and	O
excellent	O
ambient	B-A

We	O
ordered	O
some	O
beef	B-A
and	I-A
noodle	I-A
soup	I-A
dishes	I-A
from	O
the	O
Thai	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
menu	O
but	O
nothing	O
we	O
got	O
was	O
Thai	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
disappointed	O

We	O
wont	O
go	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
again	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
meal	B-A

However	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
place	B-A
is	O
a	O
good	O
hang	O
out	O
spot	O

Next	O
time	O
we	O
wouldnt	O
dare	O
ordering	O
anything	O
else	O
other	O
than	O
some	O
simple	O
Asian	O
appetizers	O
and	O
drinks	O

My	O
Girlfriend	O
and	O
I	O
stumbled	O
onto	O
this	O
hopping	O
place	B-A
the	O
other	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
time	O

THe	O
Pizza	B-A

toobut	O
what	O
really	O
MADE	O
this	O

I	O

on	O
a	O

to	O
enjoy	O
it	O

Check	O
this	O
place	B-A
out	O

HIGHLY	O
RECOMMENDED	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
place	B-A
is	O
not	O
romantic	O
as	O
claimed	O
by	O
Citysearchs	O
editorial	O
review	O

Either	O
that	O
or	O
the	O
editors	O

the	O
next	O

while	O
trying	O
to	O

louder	O

the	O

on	O
57th	O

The	O
tables	B-A
are	O
crammed	O
way	O
too	O
close	O
the	O
menu	B-A
is	O
typical	O
of	O
any	O
Italian	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O

start	O
at	O
70	O
with	O
only	O
one	O
selection	O

Service	B-A
is	O
not	O
what	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
joint	O
in	O
this	O
price	O
category	O

For	O

does	O
not	O
constitute	O
proper	O
service	B-A

To	O
be	O
completely	O
fair	O
the	O
only	O
redeeming	O
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-A
which	O
was	O
above	O

couldnt	O

The	O

and	O
you	O
may	O
feel	O
a	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

for	O
a	O

of	O
our	O
lemon	B-A
salad	I-A
that	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
pepper	O
on	O
it	O
that	O
our	O
eyes	O
started	O
watering	O
the	O
food	B-A
here	O
was	O
decent	O
not	O
great	O

The	O
menu	B-A
is	O
very	O
limited	O
i	O
think	O
we	O
counted	O
4	O
or	O
5	O
entrees	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
special	O
grilled	B-A
branzino	I-A
that	O
was	O
so	O
infused	O
with	O
bone	O
it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O

The	O

in	O
this	O

is	O
very	O
dinerish	O
and	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
place	O
you	O
expect	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
Village	O
not	O
romantic	O
just	O
simple	O
small	O
and	O
sparse	O

Problem	O
is	O
nothing	O
at	O
Prune	B-A
is	O
particularly	O
memorable	O

No	O
plans	O
to	O

anytime	O
soon	O

This	O

is	O
so	O
much	O
fun	O

Our	O
family	O
never	O
expected	O
such	O
incredible	O
entertainment	O
in	O
a	O
restaurant	B-A

This	O
place	O
must	O
have	O
cost	O
the	O
owners	O
afortune	O
to	O
build	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
stuff	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
Disney	O

Our	O
food	B-A
was	O
great	O
too	O

And	O
really	O
large	O
portions	B-A

The	O

was	O
the	O

The	O

what	O

It	O
is	O

that	O
price	O

Went	O
to	O
Village	O
last	O
night	O
for	O
my	O
birthday	O

We	O
picked	O
it	O
randomly	O
without	O
a	O
recommendation	O
from	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
there	O
so	O
we	O
werent	O
sure	O
what	O
to	O
expect	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
delicious	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
halibut	B-A
special	I-A
my	O
husband	O
had	O
steak	B-A
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
topnotch	O

When	O
my	O
dessert	O
came	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
candle	O
in	O
it	O
not	O
because	O
anyone	O
asked	O
for	O
one	O
but	O
because	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
must	O
have	O
seen	O
me	O
opening	O
my	O
birthday	O
card	O
and	O
gift	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
special	O
occassion	O
of	O
some	O
sort	O

Truly	O
the	O
mark	O
of	O
an	O
attentive	O
waiter	B-A

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
based	O
on	O
our	O
experience	O
last	O
night	O

We	O
ate	O
at	O
this	O
Thai	O
place	O
following	O
the	O
reviews	O
but	O
very	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O
foods	B-A

We	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
using	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
MSG	O
cooking	O
in	O
the	O
foods	B-A

Why	O

They	O
dont	O
concern	O
much	O
of	O
customers	O
health	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
money	O

please	O
dont	O

and	O
the	O
soupy	B-A
dumplings	I-A
certainly	O
the	O
stir	B-A
fry	I-A
blue	I-A
crab	I-A

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-A
are	O
nice	O

Of	O
course	O
it	O
is	O

who	O
cares	O

Authentic	O

I	O
cannot	O
recommend	O
a	O
better	O
Shanghai	O
place	O

Have	O
frequented	O
ino	O
for	O
several	O

the	O

Cheese	B-A

I	O
loved	O
this	O
place	B-A

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
review	O
because	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O
so	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O
become	O
to	O
crowded	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
very	O
good	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-A
its	O
self	O
was	O

The	O
wait	B-A
staff	I-A
is	O
very	O
freindly	O
they	O
make	O
it	O
feel	O
like	O
youre	O
eating	O
in	O
a	O
freindly	O
little	O
european	O
town	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	B-A
Noir	I-A
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-A
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
terrible	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
allowed	O
to	O
be	O
served	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
concerned	O
of	O
looking	O
good	O
than	O
actually	O
waitressing	O

After	O
dinner	O
the	O
manager	B-A
grabbed	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
asked	O
him	O
Where	O
are	O
you	O
frommaybe	O
you	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
work	O
in	O
Americaand	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
stormed	O
away	O
almost	O
teareyed	O
yelling	O
that	O
tips	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
they	O
survive	O
on	O

We	O
did	O
tip	O
I	O
guess	O
the	O
modelwaitress	B-A
just	O
wanted	O
more	O
and	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
manager	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	B-A
Noir	I-A
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-A
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
place	O

Pizza	B-A
here	O
is	O
consistently	O
good	O

Salads	B-A
are	O
a	O
delicious	O
way	O
to	O
begin	O
the	O

You	O
should	O
pass	O
on	O
the	O
calamari	B-A

It	O
is	O
thick	O
and	O
slightly	O

Decor	B-A
is	O

Service	B-A
is	O
average	O

What	O
a	O
great	O
place	B-A

I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O
restaurant	O
because	O
a	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
husband	O

The	O
ambience	B-A
was	O
so	O
fun	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
were	O
great	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
really	O
tasty	O

I	O
wasnt	O
thrilled	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
line	O
for	O
thirty	O
minutes	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
thats	O
the	O
price	O
you	O
pay	O
for	O
a	O
popular	O
place	O

I	O
would	O
definitely	O
recommend	O
SEA	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
thai	B-A
cuisine	I-A

I	O
was	O
here	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
back	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
worst	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A
experience	O
at	O
a	O
restaurant	O
ever	O

A	O
gentleman	B-A
maybe	O
the	O

came	O
to	O
our	O
table	O
and	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
smile	O
or	O
greeting	O
asked	O
for	O
our	O
order	O

When	O
asked	O
about	O
how	O
a	O
certain	O
dish	O
was	O
prepared	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
a	O
similar	O
at	O
other	O

restaurants	O
he	O
replied	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
Mcdonalds	O
every	O
place	O
makes	O
things	O
differently	O

While	O
it	O
is	O
understandable	O
that	O
every	O
place	O
is	O
indeed	O
different	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
uncourteous	O
to	O
customers	O
and	O
downright	O
rude	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
poor	O
restaurant	O
poorly	O
lit	O
staff	O
not	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
rather	O
eaten	O
at	O
a	O
Mcdonalds	O
than	O
this	O

Never	O
again	O

I	O
absolutely	O
Loved	O
this	O

My	O

spoke	O

much	O
about	O

I	O

I	O

that	O

The	O

I	O

The	O

they	O
seemed	O
really	O

and	O
the	O

all	O
I	O

magnificent	O

From	O
the	O
spectacular	O

to	O
the	O
hospitable	O

I	O
felt	O
like	O
royalty	O
and	O
enjoyed	O
every	O

it	O

Considering	O
we	O

restaurant	B-A

i	O
went	O
to	O
utsav	O
about	O
a	O
yr	O
ago	O
with	O
my	O
family	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O

The	O
place	B-A
was	O
nice	O
and	O
calm	O

but	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
a	O
bit	O
slow	O

I	O
work	O
around	O
the	O
corner	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
colleague	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O

The	O
buffet	B-A
had	O
a	O
nice	O
selection	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
average	O
or	O
above	O
including	O
some	O
surprising	O
tasty	O
dishes	B-A

Service	B-A
was	O
also	O
very	O
good	O

I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O

I	O
got	O
an	O
excellent	O
piece	O
of	O
cheesecake	B-A
and	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
other	O
nice	O
pastries	B-A

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
Roxys	O
for	O
that	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-A

My	O
son	O
and	O
his	O
girlfriend	O
both	O
wanted	O
cheeseburgers	B-A
and	O
they	O
were	O
huge	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
big	O
for	O
the	O
bun	O

Consequently	O
their	O
burgers	B-A
fell	O
apart	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
mess	O
that	O
they	O
didnt	O
feel	O

finishing	O
them	O

Also	O
they	O
were	O

I	O
had	O
a	O

It	O
was	O

This	O

they	O
have	O

about	O
the	O
most	O

part	O
of	O
a	O

the	O

The	O
last	O
two	O

from	O
here	O
my	O
food	B-A
was	O
soo	O
spicy	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O

it	O
and	O
the	O

when	O
I	O

claimed	O
the	O

A	O

cordial	O

She	O

and	O
helped	O
us	O
in	O
ordering	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
good	O
dishes	B-A
since	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
about	O
Indian	O
food	O

We	O
were	O
fast	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
appetizer	O

since	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
hungry	O

The	O
food	B-A
looked	O
very	O
appetizing	O
and	O
delicious	O
since	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
a	O

Good	O
for	O

or	O
with	O

I	O
am	O
reluctant	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
want	O
my	O
jem	O
of	O
a	O
pizza	B-A
place	I-A
to	O
become	O

However	O
it	O
is	O
jus	O
too	O
good	O
to	O
not	O
praise	O
it	O

By	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
pizza	B-A
in	O
Manhattan	O

The	O

the	O

the	O

For	O

We	O
arrived	O
on	O
time	O
for	O
our	O

The	O
menu	B-A
has	O
so	O
many	O
fish	O
items	O
and	O
oysters	O

We	O
all	O
ordered	O
different	O
entrees	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
share	O

The	O
fish	B-A
was	O
reallyreally	O
fresh	O

I	O
lived	O
in	O
Maine	O
for	O
ten	O
years	O
and	O
grew	O
up	O
on	O
fish	O

We	O
all	O
agreed	O
that	O
mare	B-A
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
seafood	O
restaurants	O
in	O
New	O
York	O

I	O
stumbled	O
upon	O
this	O
great	O
pizzeria	B-A
as	O
I	O
explored	O
my	O
new	O
neighborhood	O

All	O
of	O
the	O
pizzas	B-A
are	O
terrific	O
and	O
the	O
price	O
is	O
even	O
better	O

I	O
highly	O
recommend	O
the	O
Sophia	B-A
pizza	I-A

Its	O
to	O
die	O
for	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
mediocre	O
at	O
best	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
that	O
made	O
me	O
vow	O
never	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

Immediately	O
after	O
we	O
paid	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
took	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
said	O
okay	O
you	O

There	O
are	O

We	O
werent	O

Our	O

So	O

This	O
tiny	O
Williamsburg	B-A
spot	I-A
is	O
always	O
pleasantly	O
surprising	O

The	O
pizza	B-A
is	O
delicious	O
and	O
the	O
proprietor	B-A
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
nicest	O
in	O
NYC	O

Even	O
the	O
pasta	O
is	O
delicious	O
here	O
a	O
rarity	O
in	O
New	O
York	O
pizza	O
restaurants	O

Ive	O
been	O

They	O
even	O

it	O

not	O
too	O
much	O

The	O
cream	B-A

are	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
world	O
and	O
I	O
love	O
that	O
coffee	B-A

A	O
little	O
crowded	O
but	O
they	O
move	O
that	O
line	O
really	O
fast	O

A	O
little	O
pricey	O
but	O
it	O
really	O
hits	O
the	O
spot	O
on	O
a	O
Sunday	O
morning	O

Bagels	B-A
are	O
ok	O
but	O
be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
special	O
requests	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
an	O
open	O
faced	O
cheese	O
sandwich	O
and	O
the	O
manager	B-A
basically	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
business	O
elsewhere	O

Be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
anything	O
other	O
than	O
bagels	B-A

the	O
turkey	B-A
burgers	I-A
are	O
scary	O

The	O
worst	O
excuse	O
for	O
Japanese	B-A
food	I-A
Ive	O
ever	O
encountered	O

The	O
soup	B-A
for	I-A
the	I-A
udon	I-A
was	O
soy	O
sauce	O
and	O
water	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
was	O
awful	O

The	O
rice	B-A
was	O
poor	O
quality	O
and	O
was	O
cooked	O
so	O
badly	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O

Furthermore	O
the	O
rice	B-A
had	O
no	O
seasoning	O
so	O
the	O
sushi	B-A
was	O
bland	O
and	O
disgusting	O

The	O
fish	B-A
was	O
adequate	O
but	O
inexpertly	O
sliced	O

It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
restaurant	O
has	O
any	O
idea	O
about	O
or	O
experience	O
with	O
Japanese	B-A
cuisine	I-A

Good	O

your	O

I	O
will	O

I	O

I	O
wish	O
they	O
would	O

back	O
to	O
what	O
it	O

The	O

The	O

After	O

this	O

for	O

I	O
finally	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
have	O
dinner	O

I	O
was	O
pleasantly	O
suprised	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
exceptional	O

The	O
menu	O
consisted	O
of	O
standard	O
brassiere	O
food	O
better	O
then	O
places	O
like	O
Balthazar	O

I	O
choose	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
special	O
the	O
braised	B-A
lamb	I-A
shank	I-A
in	I-A
red	I-A

which	O
was	O
excellent	O

The	O
service	B-A
was	O
friendly	O
and	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O
casual	O

The	O
restaurant	B-A
is	O
a	O
bit	O
noisy	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
overlooked	O
once	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
enjoy	O
a	O
great	O
meal	B-A

this	O
little	O
place	B-A
has	O

and	O

the	O

ew	I-A
chicken	I-A
was	O
delicious	O
however	O
the	O

i	O
would	O
just	O

Finally	O
a	O
reliable	O
Chinese	B-A
restaurant	I-A

This	O
place	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
served	O
by	O
being	O
run	O
by	O
a	O
group	O
that	O
actually	O
understands	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A

The	O
only	O
thing	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
here	O
is	O
walk	O
in	O
and	O
eat	O
but	O
planning	O
an	O

especially	O
a	O
small	O
intimate	O
one	O
forget	O
about	O
it	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
helpful	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
and	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
the	O

run	O
around	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
event	O
date	O
rolls	O
around	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
regret	O
chosing	O
this	O

but	O
also	O
become	O

Nobody	O
at	O
this	O

they	O

and	O
they	O

that	O

The	O

the	O

of	O
opinion	O
some	O
may	O
consider	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

thing	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying	O

If	O

you	O

then	O
your	O

if	O

youll	O

and	O
wonder	O
whats	O

all	O
the	O

it	O

The	O

okay	O
and	O
the	O

You	O

is	O
that	O

He	O

about	O
20	O

there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
groups	O
of	O

The	O

was	O
extensive	O
though	O
the	O
staff	B-A
did	O
not	O
seem	O
knowledgeable	O
about	O

The	O

we	O

cold	O
and	O
the	O
free	O
appetizer	B-A
of	I-A

was	O
disappointing	O

However	O
our	O
main	B-A

was	O

I	O
had	O
fish	B-A
and	O
my	O
husband	O
had	O
the	O

both	O
of	O
which	O
exceeded	O
our	O

The	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

was	O
good	O
but	O
once	O
again	O
the	O

was	O

When	O
we	O

about	O

the	O
waitress	B-A
listed	O
off	O
several	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
know	O

Not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
expect	O
for	O
the	O
price	O
and	O
prestige	O
of	O
this	O
location	B-A

All	O
in	O
all	O
I	O
would	O
return	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
beautiful	O
restaurant	B-A
but	O
I	O
hope	O
the	O
staff	B-A
pays	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
little	O
details	O
in	O
the	O

what	O

the	O

been	O
wanting	O

to	O

got	O
a	O
table	O

The	O
menu	B-A
looked	O
great	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
was	O
very	O
nice	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
food	B-A
came	O
it	O
was	O
average	O

Nevertheless	O
I	O
finished	O
my	O
plate	O
and	O
thats	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
maggot	O
in	O
mushroom	B-A
sauce	I-A
at	O
the	O
bottom	O

I	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
manager	B-A
and	O
he	O
smilingly	O
apologized	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
two	O
free	O
desserts	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
ask	O
us	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
and	O
so	O
brought	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
desserts	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
asked	O
for	O

When	O
the	O
bill	O
came	O
nothing	O
was	O
comped	O
so	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
manager	O
very	O
politely	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
wine	O
but	O
I	O
didnt	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
food	O
with	O
a	O
maggot	O
in	O
it	O

Yes	O
I	O
ate	O
the	O
food	O
but	O
I	O
certainly	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
maggot	O
before	O
eating	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
fairly	O
sick	O
to	O
my	O
stomach	O

The	O
manager	B-A
finally	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
comp	O
the	O
two	O
glasses	O
of	O
wine	O
which	O
cost	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
seem	O
like	O
a	O
big	O
concession	O

We	O
paid	O
and	O
left	O
because	O
we	O
didnt	O
feel	O

had	O
a	O

Cant	O

about	O
that	O

they	O
are	O

What	O
you	O

Yes	O
the	O

I	O
read	O
reviews	O
that	O
called	O
the	O

too	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O

may	O

The	B-A
Four	I-A
Seasons	I-A
has	O
history	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
landmark	O
of	O
New	O
York	O
City	O
restaurants	O
but	O
trust	O
me	O
they	O
will	O
charge	O
you	O
through	O
the	O
nose	O
just	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
say	O
Ive	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
four	O
seasons	O
restaurant	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O
and	O
sadly	O
curiousity	O
got	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
paid	O
dearly	O
for	O
it	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
great	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
dessserts	B-A

The	O
environment	B-A
is	O
very	O
upscale	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
rich	O
guys	O
with	O
trophy	O
wives	O
or	O
just	O
highly	O
paid	O
escorts	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-A
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
worth	O
it	O

Yes	O
it	O
is	O
good	O
but	O
Ive	O
had	O
better	O
for	O
cheaper	O

You	O
would	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
it	O
with	O
service	B-A
sadly	O
no	O

Service	B-A
was	O
just	O
ok	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
what	O
youd	O
expect	O
for	O
500	O

Terrible	O
Waste	O
of	O
money	O
scammers	O

I	O
agree	O
that	O
dining	O
at	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
is	O
like	O
no	O
other	O
dining	O
experience	O

BUT	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way	O

I	O
am	O
actually	O
offended	O
to	O
have	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O

I	O
literally	O
just	O
got	O
back	O
home	O
after	O
visiting	O
Casa	B-A
La	I-A
Femme	I-A
and	O
was	O
so	O
offended	O
by	O
my	O
visit	O
felt	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
warn	O
other	O
diners	O
who	O
value	O
their	O
money	O
and	O
time	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
celebrate	O
two	O
birthdays	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
special	O
and	O
different	O

Our	O
visit	O
their	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
least	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
and	O
costly	O
experience	O

And	O
even	O
more	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
costly	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O

We	O
did	O
arrive	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-A
for	O
a	O
table	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
1015	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
45	O
minutes	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
wait	O
momentarily	O
and	O
upon	O
arrival	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O

The	O
place	B-A
is	O
beautiful	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O

However	O
our	O
14	O
drinks	B-A
were	O
were	O
horrible	O

Once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table	O
despite	O
indicating	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
alla	O
carte	O
menu	O
we	O
were	O
pushed	O
into	O
a	O
table	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
price	O
fixed	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O
so	O
long	O
we	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O

Our	O
experience	O
did	O
not	O
ever	O
get	O
any	O
better	O

For	O
each	O
course	O
we	O
waited	O
over	O
12	O
hour	O
to	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
were	O
never	O
offered	O
a	O
drink	O

We	O
also	O
asked	O
for	O
Hooka	O
six	O
times	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
kept	O
telling	O
us	O
one	O
minute	O
and	O
never	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
Hooka	O

After	O
the	O
4th	O
time	O
i	O
asked	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
than	O
said	O
after	O
our	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O

and	O
never	O

them	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
than	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
order	O

My	O
chicken	B-A
was	O
inedible	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
fatty	O
lumps	O
which	O
i	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
spitting	O
out	O
into	O
my	O
napkin	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
expect	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
55	O
dinner	B-A

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
dinner	O
we	O
still	O
had	O
not	O
received	O
one	O
beverage	O
NOR	O
hooka	O

What	O
we	O
did	O
do	O
was	O
waste	O
3	O
hours	O
being	O
trapped	O
in	O
a	O
table	O
waiting	O
and	O
waiting	O
for	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
and	O
hooka	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
never	O
received	O

The	O
only	O
beverage	O
we	O
did	O
receive	O
was	O
water	O
in	O
dirty	O
glasses	O

To	O
top	O
it	O
all	O
off	O
the	O
main	O
reason	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
your	O
restaurant	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
belly	O
dancers	O
and	O
missed	O
the	O
first	O
show	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
seated	O
yet	O
and	O
the	O
2nd	O
belly	O
dancer	O
only	O
danced	O
at	O
two	O
tables	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
never	O
made	O
it	O
around	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
wallets	O
were	O
empy	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
our	O
stomachs	O
AND	O
we	O
missed	O
the	O
show	O
we	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
see	O
following	O
our	O
dinner	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
acceptable	O
if	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
experience	O
of	O
good	O
food	B-A
and	O
belly	O
dancers	O

If	O
it	O
seemed	O
possible	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
while	O
there	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
fought	O
my	O
bill	O
since	O
my	O
dinner	O
portion	O
of	O
my	O
meal	B-A
was	O
inedible	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
left	O
a	O
restaurant	B-A
feeling	O
as	O
if	O
i	O
was	O
abused	O
and	O
wasted	O
my	O
hard	O
earned	O
money	O

MY	O
husbands	O
birthday	O
and	O
my	O
sons	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
intended	O
and	O
we	O
drove	O
two	O
hours	O
to	O
spend	O
too	O
much	O
money	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
terribly	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
COULD	O
be	O
refunded	O

Dont	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
larger	O
group	O
than	O
4	O

I	O
went	O
here	O
for	O
a	O
family	O
birthday	O
dinner	O

Five	O
of	O
us	O
walked	O
in	O
at	O
approximately	O
620	O
on	O
a	O
Thursday	O
evening	O

The	O
hostess	O
said	O
Wow	O
thats	O
a	O
large	O
group	O
unless	O
you	O
arent	O
together	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
replied	O
no	O
we	O
are	O
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
one	O
more	O
so	O
a	O
table	O
for	O
six	O
please	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O

The	O
menu	B-A
is	O
fairly	O
simple	O
without	O
much	O
descriptions	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
tap	O
beer	B-A
that	O
evening	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
disappointment	O

Not	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
selection	B-A
of	I-A
bottled	I-A
beer	I-A
either	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
Brahma	O

The	O
appetizers	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
served	O
quickly	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
fried	B-A
oysters	I-A
and	I-A
clams	I-A
were	O
delicious	O
but	O
a	O
tiny	O
portion	O
maybe	O
3	O
of	O
each	O

The	O
lobster	B-A
knuckles	I-A
special	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
were	O
ok	O
but	O
pretty	O
tasteless	O

I	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
2	O
shrimp	O
in	O
the	O
salt	B-A
encrusted	I-A
shrimp	I-A
appetizer	I-A

After	O
we	O
ate	O
our	O
appetizers	O
which	O
took	O
all	O
of	O
8	O
minutes	O
we	O
ordered	O
another	O
round	O
of	O
Brahmas	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
stall	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
our	O
sixth	O
dinner	O
member	O

The	O
waitress	O
appeared	O
and	O
asked	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
order	O

We	O
replied	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
5	O
more	O
minutes	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
okay	O

She	O
replied	O
well	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
for	O
us	O
if	O
you	O
ordered	O
now	O
since	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
larger	O
party	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
get	O
crowded	O

We	O
called	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
close	O
by	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
us	O
to	O
order	O
for	O
her	O
so	O
we	O
did	O

The	O
food	O
arrived	O
in	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
Thai	B-A
style	I-A
Fried	I-A
Sea	I-A
Bass	I-A
which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O

Everyone	O
seemed	O
generally	O
happy	O
with	O
their	O
food	B-A
except	O
my	O
brother	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
grilled	B-A
Mahi	I-A
Mahi	I-A
seemingly	O
drenched	O
in	O
Grapfruit	O
Juice	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
lobster	B-A
roll	I-A
was	O
excellent	O

They	O
seemed	O
to	O
continue	O
to	O
rush	O
us	O
along	O
taking	O
plates	O
without	O
asking	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
done	O
my	O
sister	O
still	O
had	O
her	O
fork	O
in	O
hand	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
expensive	O
side	O
but	O
fresh	O

Service	B-A
not	O
the	O
friendliest	O
to	O
our	O
large	O
party	O

Probably	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
here	O

Great	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A

I	O
lived	O
on	O
50th	O
st	O
and	O
wanted	O
Indian	O
one	O
day	O
so	O
decided	O
to	O
check	O
this	O
place	O
out	O

Food	B-A
was	O
amazing	O
I	O
love	O
Indian	O
food	O
and	O
eat	O
it	O
quite	O
regularly	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
Ive	O
had	O

Very	O
normal	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A
but	O
done	O
really	O
well	O

I	O
have	O
it	O
a	O
4	O
instead	O
of	O
5	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
just	O
chicken	B-A
tikka	I-A
masala	I-A
no	O
bread	O
of	O
rice	O
is	O
25	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
expect	O
at	O
a	O
upscale	O
Indian	O
restaurant	O
but	O
this	O
place	B-A
doesnt	O
have	O
an	O
upscale	O
feel	B-A

Also	O
waiters	B-A
try	O
to	O
push	O
more	O
food	O
on	O
you	O
like	O
suggest	O
things	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
complimentary	O
when	O
they	O
actually	O
cost	O

I	O
dont	O
appreciate	O
places	O
or	O
people	O
that	O
try	O
to	O
drive	O
up	O
the	O
bill	O
without	O
the	O
patrons	O
knowledge	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
huge	O
turnoff	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
price	O

But	O
if	O
youre	O
prepared	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
and	O
remember	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
something	O
they	O
offer	O
is	O
complimentary	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
place	B-A
to	O
go	O
for	O
Indian	B-A
food	I-A

This	O

the	O

review	O
I	O
have	O

about	O

They	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
tonight	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
restaurant	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
so	O
disgusted	O
by	O
both	O
food	B-A
an	O
service	B-A

For	O
starters	O
they	O
delivered	O
us	O
someone	O
elses	O

Fine	O
I	O
wont	O
hang	O
you	O
for	O
that	O

However	O
once	O
I	O
received	O
my	O
predictably	O
mediocre	O
order	O
of	O
what	O
Dokebi	O
thinks	O
passes	O
as	O
Korean	B-A
fair	I-A
sometimes	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
settle	O
when	O
its	O
your	O
only	O
option	O
I	O
got	O
through	O
about	O
half	O
my	O
kimchee	B-A
before	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
random	O
lettuce	O
accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
far	O
more	O
disgusting	O
slimy	O
clearly	O
bad	O
piece	O
of	O
fish	O
skin	O

Not	O
one	O
to	O
jump	O
to	O
complaints	O
hence	O
my	O
lack	O
of	O
previous	O
online	O
reviewing	O
I	O
called	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
heads	O
up	O
that	O
their	O
kitchen	O
might	O
want	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
cleanliness	O
of	O
their	O
prep	O
stations	O

My	O
main	O
concern	O
was	O
the	O
sanity	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-A
that	O
was	O
being	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
myself	O
and	O
others	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
lying	O
is	O
I	O
said	O
that	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
worked	O
in	O
restaurants	O
since	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
fifteen	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
minimal	O
effort	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
amend	O
the	O
situation	O

None	O
was	O
made	O
so	O
i	O
hung	O
up	O

Less	O
than	O
three	O
minutes	O
passed	O
before	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
doubled	O
over	O
the	O
toilet	O

My	O
girlfriend	O
being	O
slightly	O
more	O
aggressive	O
and	O
having	O
been	O
equally	O
disgusted	O
causing	O
her	O
to	O
throw	O
out	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
her	O
barely	O
eaten	O
meal	B-A
called	O
back	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
probably	O
wrong	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
an	O
oyster	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
blacklisted	O
from	O
their	O
restaurant	O

Not	O
only	O
have	O
I	O
worked	O
in	O

for	O
many	O
years	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
in	O

I	O

a	O
huge	O
lover	O
of	O
oysters	O
and	O

and	O
my	O

is	O
half	O
Korean	O

We	O
know	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
and	O
oyster	O
and	O
bad	O
fish	O

It	O
wasnt	O
as	O
if	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
had	O
any	O
major	O

My	O

and	O
I	O
visited	O
Dokebi	O
tonight	O

We	O
ordered	O
dosut	O
bibimbap	O
and	O
nakgibokum	O

The	O
dishes	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
5	O
minutes	O
apart	O

The	O
bibimbap	B-A
was	O
average	O
but	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A
wasnt	O
even	O
close	O
to	O
sizzling	O

Too	O
bad	O
I	O
had	O
paid	O
an	O
extra	O
2	O
for	O
the	O
stone	B-A
bowl	I-A

The	O
nakgibokum	B-A
was	O
horrible	O

Easily	O
the	O
worst	O
stirfried	B-A
squid	I-A
Ive	O
ever	O
tasted	O

The	O
sauce	B-A
tasted	O
more	O
like	O
Chinese	O
fast	O
food	O
than	O
decent	O
Korean	O

The	O
side	B-A
dishes	I-A
were	O
passable	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
get	O
a	O
refill	O
upon	O

The	O
real	O
problem	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
this	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
complete	O
lack	O
of	O
service	B-A

I	O
mentioned	O
the	O
squid	O
dish	O
wasnt	O
very	O
good	O
when	O
the	O
waitress	O
visited	O

She	O
just	O
nodded	O
and	O
walked	O
off	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
communications	O

either	O

she	O
spoke	O

As	O
to	O
my	O
comment	O
about	O
the	O

no	O
apology	O

My	O

Love	O
this	O
place	B-A
every	O
time	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
we	O
always	O
go	O

A	O
quintessential	O
slice	B-A
of	I-A
NYC	I-A
pizza	I-A

The	O
crust	B-A
has	O
a	O
great	O
bite	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
chew	O
the	O
sauce	B-A
is	O
light	O
with	O
a	O
nice	O
acidity	O
to	O
it	O
the	O
salt	O
from	O
the	O
cheese	B-A
is	O
great	O
really	O
heightens	O
the	O
flavor	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
components	O

Personally	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
margherita	B-A
pizza	I-A
better	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
good	O

Possibly	O
the	O
Most	O
Romantic	O
Restaurant	B-A
in	O
the	O
City	O

This	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
my	O
favorite	O
modern	B-A
Japanese	I-A
brasserie	I-A
that	O
don’t	O
serve	O
sushi	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
romantic	O
restaurants	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
it	O
an	O
adventure	O
getting	O
to	O
this	O
somewhat	O
hidden	O
spot	B-A
once	O
you	O
enter	O
the	O
unmarked	B-A
wooden	I-A
doors	I-A
the	O
zen	O
and	O
intimate	O
décor	B-A
will	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you’re	O
no	O
longer	O
in	O
the	O
city	O

If	O
you’re	O
planning	O
to	O
come	O
here	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
your	O
date	O
is	O
someone	O
whom	O
you	O
really	O
like	O
since	O
you’ll	O
be	O
ushered	O
to	O
private	B-A
booths	I-A
where	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
people	O
or	O
food	O
watching	O
choose	O
the	O
ones	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
level	O
that	O
have	O
glass	B-A
ceilings	I-A
so	O
you	O
may	O
see	O
the	O
stars	O
in	O
the	O
sky	O

It’s	O
just	O
you	O
and	O
your	O
date	O
and	O
an	O
occasional	O
cute	O
‘excuse	O
me’	O
before	O
the	O
waiter	B-A
opens	O
the	O
little	O
curtain	O
to	O
your	O
booth	O

My	O
party	O
had	O
the	O
BBE	B-A
29	I-A
fixe	I-A
prix	I-A
menu	I-A
which	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
wonderful	O
deal	O
since	O
it	O
also	O
came	O
with	O
a	O
flight	O
of	O
sake	O

I	O
never	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
fan	O
of	O
sakes	O
but	O
am	O
lately	O
experimenting	O
with	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
and	O
am	O
acquiring	O
a	O
better	O
taste	O
of	O
it	O

We	O
started	O
off	O
with	O
a	O
delightful	O
sashimi	B-A
amuse	I-A
bouche	I-A

Our	O
first	O
course	O
was	O
Tuna	O
Sashimi	O
with	O
Green	O
Yuzu	O
Sauce	O

I	O
picked	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Black	I-A
Cod	I-A
as	O
my	O
entree	O
which	O
I	O
absolutely	O
devoured	O
while	O
someone	O
commented	O
that	O
the	O
Grilled	B-A
Salmon	I-A
dish	I-A
was	O
better	O

The	O
entrees	O
were	O
served	O
with	O
miso	O
soup	O
and	O
rice	O

The	O
sake’s	B-A
complimented	O
the	O
courses	O
very	O
well	O
and	O
is	O
successfully	O
easing	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
sake	O
world	O

For	O
desserts	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
frozen	B-A
black	I-A
sesame	I-A
mousse	I-A
interesting	O
but	O
not	O
extraordinary	O
and	O
matcha	B-A
powdered	I-A
green	I-A
tea	I-A
and	I-A
blueberry	I-A
cheesecake	I-A
which	O
was	O
phenomenal	O

Maybe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
company	O
I	O
had	O
friends	O
visiting	O
from	O
Philly	O
–	O
yes	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
date	O
this	O
time	O
or	O
the	O
super	O
reasonable	O
price	O
point	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
can’t	O
say	O
enough	O
good	O
things	O
about	O
this	O
brasserie	B-A

I	O
don’t	O
usually	O
visit	O
the	O
same	O
establishment	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
what	O
more	O
twice	O
but	O
I’ll	O
come	O
to	O
Zenkichi	B-A
anytime	O
for	O
a	O
quiet	O
unhurried	O
and	O
memorable	O
dinner	O

Terrible	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
compliment	O

The	O
service	B-A
leaves	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
from	O
feeling	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
rushed	O
the	O
place	O
your	O
order	O
to	O
being	O
ignored	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
night	O

We	O
were	O
10	O
people	O
celebrtating	O
a	O
birthday	O
we	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O
tent	O

We	O
paid	O
a	O
fixed	O
pricce	O
but	O
got	O
nothing	O

We	O
never	O
ate	O
because	O
by	O
close	O
to	O
2	O
in	O
the	O
monring	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
served	O
and	O
were	O
too	O
upset	O
ad	O
tired	O
to	O
start	O
eating	O

They	O
are	O
extremely	O
rude	O
not	O
even	O
apologizing	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
service	B-A
we	O
got	O
and	O
handing	O
us	O

I	O

here	O
at	O

once	O
every	O

week	O
particularly	O
when	O
its	O

the	O
Shabu	O
Shabu	O

I	O
tried	O
a	O
couple	O
other	O
dishes	B-A
but	O
wasnt	O
too	O
impressed	O

But	O
for	O
the	O
Shabu	B-A
Shabu	I-A
you	O
wont	O
find	O
much	O
better	O
in	O
NY	O

In	O
fact	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
Ive	O
tried	O
that	O
even	O
compares	O
shabu	O
Tatsu	O
and	O
even	O
then	O
I	O
prefer	O
Dokebi	O

The	O
meat	B-A
is	O
fresh	O
the	O
sauces	B-A
are	O
great	O
you	O
get	O
kimchi	B-A
and	O
a	O
salad	B-A
free	O
with	O
your	O
meal	B-A
and	O
service	B-A
is	O
good	O
too	O

Dokebi	O

classic	O

The	O
hot	B-A

are	O
good	O
yes	O
but	O
the	O
reason	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
here	O
is	O
the	O
fantastic	O
pork	B-A
croquette	I-A

its	O

Celebrated	O
my	O
fathers	O
birthday	O
here	O

The	O
food	B-A
tasted	O
very	O
good	O

The	O
family	B-A
seafood	I-A
entree	I-A
was	O
very	O
good	O

The	O
main	B-A
entree	I-A
was	O
also	O
very	O
good	O

We	O
order	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
menu	O

Price	O
is	O
high	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
good	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
again	O

This	O
place	B-A
doesnt	O
make	O
any	O
sense	O

Just	O
want	O
to	O
warn	O
you	O
all	O
dont	O
waste	O
your	O
time	O
and	O
money	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
totally	O
weird	O
decor	B-A
stairs	O
going	O
up	O
with	O

walls	I-A
I	O
am	O

how	O
no	O
one	O
yet	O
broke	O
their	O
head	O
or	O
fall	O
off	O
the	O
stairs	O
mirrored	O
walls	O
make	O
you	O
dizzy	O
and	O
delusional	O

This	O
place	B-A
is	O
not	O
inviting	O
and	O
the	O
food	B-A
is	O
totally	O
weird	O

The	O
concept	O
of	O
japanese	B-A
tapas	I-A
is	O
newly	O
created	O
and	O
clearly	O
doesnt	O
work	O

The	O
food	B-A
they	O
serve	O
is	O
not	O
comforting	O
not	O
appetizing	O
and	O
uncooked	O

Go	O
to	O
japanese	O
sushi	O
place	O
or	O
Spanish	O

place	O
this	O

Good	O
Food	B-A

I	O
went	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
great	O
and	O
tasty	O
but	O
the	O
sitting	B-A
space	I-A
was	O
too	O
small	O
I	O
dont	O
like	O
being	O
cramp	O
in	O
a	O
corner	O

Over	O
all	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
nice	O
romantic	O
place	B-A

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
to	O
ask	O
for	O
a	O
bigger	O
sitting	O
area	O
when	O
you	O
make	O
a	O
reservation	O
if	O
possible	O

Loved	O
it	O

A	O
coworker	O
and	O
I	O
tried	O
Pacifico	B-A
after	O
work	O
a	O
few	O
Fridays	O
and	O
loved	O
it	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O
great	O

The	O
food	B-A
we	O
ordered	O
was	O
excellent	O
although	O
I	O
wouldnt	O
say	O
the	O
margaritas	B-A
were	O
anything	O
to	O
write	O
home	O
about	O

Our	O
waitress	B-A
wasnt	O
mean	O
but	O
not	O
especially	O
warm	O
or	O
attentive	O
either	O

I	O
must	O
say	O
I	O
am	O
surprised	O
by	O
the	O
bad	O
reviews	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
earlier	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
though	O

Maybe	O
it	O
has	O
improved	O
since	O
then	O

Regardless	O
well	O
be	O
back	O
and	O
cant	O
wait	O
to	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
to	O
take	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
patio	B-A

Dumbfoundingly	O
Poor	O

This	O
was	O
from	O
start	O
to	O
finish	O
a	O
mindbogglingly	O
uncomfortable	O
experience	O

Lexicographers	O
take	O
note	O
a	O

definition	O
of	O

The	O
servers	B-A
at	O
Flatbush	O
Farm	O
appear	O
to	O
have	O
perfected	O
that	O
ghastly	O
technique	O
of	O
making	O
you	O
feel	O
guilty	O
and	O
ashamed	O
for	O
deigning	O
to	O
attract	O
their	O
attention	O

Polite	O

out	O

supercilious	O

And	O
how	O
many	O
times	O
can	O
you	O
pick	O
up	O
the	O

perfectly	O

I	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
and	O
I	O
are	O
avid	O
restaurant	O
goers	O
and	O
we	O
are	O
always	O
on	O
the	O
lookout	O
for	O
new	O
places	O
and	O
our	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
Flatbush	O
Farms	O

We	O
arrived	O
and	O
were	O
seated	O
immediately	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
both	O
happy	O

We	O
ordered	O
our	O
appetizers	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
the	O
salmon	O

Everything	O
was	O
going	O
good	O
until	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
meals	B-A

I	O
took	O
one	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
chicken	B-A
and	O
I	O
was	O
appalled	O

It	O
was	O
served	O
with	O
skin	O
over	O
a	O
bed	O
of	O
extremely	O
undercooked	O
spinach	B-A
and	O
mashed	O
potatoes	O

My	O
boyfriend	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
switch	O
and	O
eat	O
his	O
salmon	O
instead	O
while	O
he	O
deskinned	O
the	O
chicken	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
enjoy	O
the	O
white	O
meat	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
bite	O
from	O
the	O
24	O
salmon	B-A
and	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
in	O
the	O
17	O
years	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
restaurants	O
tasted	O
salmon	O
as	O
fishy	O
as	O
dry	O
and	O
as	O
bland	O
as	O
the	O
one	O
in	O
Flatbush	O
Farms	O

At	O
this	O
point	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
comes	O
over	O
and	O
asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	O
was	O
okay	O
I	O
was	O
literally	O
so	O
shocked	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
speechless	O
and	O
didnt	O
say	O
anything	O
and	O
guess	O
what	O
the	O
waitress	O
WALKED	O
away	O

So	O
I	O
switch	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
again	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
maybe	O
I	O
could	O
stomach	O
the	O
meat	O
and	O
spinach	O
again	O
but	O
the	O
spinach	B-A
was	O
so	O
undercooked	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
could	O
not	O
bite	O
through	O
it	O

I	O
couldnt	O
even	O
enjoy	O
the	O
mashed	O
potatoes	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
hidden	O
completely	O
under	O
the	O
chicken	O
and	O
spinach	O

Ive	O
had	O
better	O
chicken	O
at	O
BBQs	O

So	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
waitress	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible	O

Guess	O
what	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O
TWENTY	O
minutes	O
before	O
she	O
came	O
over	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
finally	O
did	O
she	O
says	O
oh	O
well	O
I	O
wish	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
something	O
earlier	O
No	O
apology	O
nothing	O

After	O
that	O
she	O
simply	O
took	O
our	O
plates	O
walked	O
away	O
came	O
back	O
another	O
TWENTY	O
minutes	O
later	O
with	O
the	O
bill	O
and	O
the	O
chicken	O
on	O
it	O

No	O
desert	O
menu	O
no	O
apology	O
nothing	O

I	O
was	O
literally	O
going	O
to	O
explode	O
but	O
instead	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
took	O
the	O
bill	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
manager	O

This	O
is	O
where	O
it	O
really	O
really	O
gets	O
bad	O
the	O
manager	B-A
said	O
there	O
is	O
absolutely	O
nothing	O
we	O
can	O
do	O
its	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
taste	O
that	O
she	O
didnt	O
like	O
it	O
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
comp	O
it	O

Again	O
no	O

the	O

the	O

you	O
almost	O

have	O
to	O

by	O
the	O

until	O
you	O

I	O
was	O
almost	O
amused	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
at	O
9pm	O
on	O
a	O
Friday	O
night	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
BBQ	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
that	O
night	O

Id	O
be	O
horrified	O
if	O
my	O
staff	B-A
were	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
so	O
early	O
and	O
so	O
rudely	O

Theres	O
another	O
girl	B-A
who	O
I	O
cant	O
describe	O
she	O
is	O
about	O
56	O
with	O
brown	O
hair	O
who	O
eavesdrops	O
on	O
your	O
conversation	O
and	O
chimes	O
in	O
except	O
she	O
only	O
hears	O
the	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
said	O
so	O
her	O
uninvited	O
opinions	O
are	O
often	O
out	O
of	O
context	O
and	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
what	O
youre	O
really	O
talking	O
about	O

Im	O
a	O
friendly	O
person	O
so	O
I	O
wouldnt	O
mind	O
had	O
she	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
nasty	O
and	O
gotten	O
so	O
personal	O

Again	O
Id	O
be	O
super	O
upset	O
if	O
that	O
were	O
my	O
employee	O

Considering	O
you	O
will	O
spend	O
at	O
least	O
60	O
a	O

I	O
expect	O
better	O
service	B-A

So	O
if	O
youre	O

about	O

you	O
might	O

The	O
food	B-A

were	O
fine	O
however	O
the	O
maitreD	B-A

incredibly	O

shortly	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
us	O

not	O

I	O

him	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
40	O
years	O
of	O

that	O
I	O

of	O
bad	O
behavior	O
by	O
a	O
frontman	B-A
in	O

His	O

with	O
his	O

on	O

all	O

The	O

the	O

Everyone	O

Highly	O

it	O

At	O

this	O

seems	O
a	O
bit	O
pricey	O
for	O
a	O

but	O
at	O
Bark	B-A
you	O
dont	O
just	O
get	O
your	O

Here	O
the	O

the	O

everything	O

Poor	O
service	B-A
and	O
management	B-A

Don’t	O
go	O
to	O
this	O

Had	O
an	O
awful	O
experience	O
at	O
Casa	B-A
la	I-A
Femme	I-A
on	O
a	O
Saturday	O
dinner	O

Appetizers	O
took	O
nearly	O
an	O
hour	O

When	O
the	O
main	O
course	O
finally	O
arrived	O
another	O
45mins	O
half	O
of	O
our	O
order	O
was	O
missing	O

Never	O
got	O
an	O
explanation	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O

The	O
manager	B-A
was	O
rude	O
and	O
handled	O
the	O
situation	O
extremely	O
poorly	O

When	O
we	O
threatened	O
to	O
leave	O
we	O
were	O
offered	O
a	O
meager	O
discount	O
even	O
though	O
half	O
the	O
order	O
was	O
missing	O

On	O
the	O
way	O
out	O
we	O
heard	O
of	O
other	O
guests	O
complaining	O
about	O
similar	O
issues	O

Can’t	O
believe	O
how	O
an	O
expensive	O
NYC	O
restaurant	B-A
can	O
be	O
so	O
disrespectful	O
to	O
its	O
clients	O

What	O
a	O
hassle	O

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
outstanding	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
it	O
justifies	O
the	O
accolades	O
it	O
receives	O
the	O
attitude	O
of	O
the	O
staff	B-A
or	O
the	O
wait	B-A
for	O
a	O
table	O

On	O
our	O
last	O
visit	O
they	O
skipped	O
over	O
our	O
name	O
on	O
the	O
list	O
leaving	O
us	O
waiting	O
an	O
extra	O
hour	O
for	O
a	O
table	O

Mistakes	O
happen	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
usually	O
accompanied	O
by	O
an	O
apology	O
perhaps	O
even	O
a	O
glass	O

not	O
the	O
grunt	O
that	O
we	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
Al	O

La	O
staff	B-A

Without	O
the	O
wait	O
or	O
attitude	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
go	O
back	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
just	O
too	O
many	O
other	O
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
that	O
are	O
as	O
good	O
or	O
better	O
and	O
dont	O
make	O
me	O
jump	O
through	O
hoops	O

Expensive	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
after	O
hearing	O
how	O
great	O
it	O
was	O

Wow	O

The	O
bread	B-A
was	O
stale	O
the	O
salad	B-A
was	O
overpriced	O
and	O
empty	O

The	O
pasta	B-A
was	O
well	O
cooked	O
didnt	O
have	O
enough	O
sauce	O
though	O
or	O
flavor	O

I	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
expensive	O
and	O
I	O
prefer	O
Bella	O
Via	O
just	O
blocks	O
away	O
by	O
far	O

So	O
rude	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
JWILS	O

Her	O
review	O
is	O
above	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
went	O
for	O
this	O
horrible	O
experience	O

My	O
friend	O
is	O
100	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
experience	O
we	O
had	O

The	O
hostess	B-A
was	O
rude	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
distinct	O
feeling	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
serve	O
us	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
left	O
out	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
the	O
bartender	B-A
disappeared	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
menu	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
waitress	B-A
looked	O
at	O
my	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
insane	O

I	O
was	O
shocked	O
that	O
my	O
friends	O
wanted	O
to	O
stay	O
after	O
the	O
waitress	B-A
said	O
can	O
I	O
help	O
you	O
and	O
how	O
many	O
are	O
in	O
your	O
party	O

What	O

The	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
her	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
were	O

We	O
didnt	O
look	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
patrons	O
in	O
there	O
so	O
unfortunately	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O

Shame	O
on	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
the	O
horrible	O
rude	O
staff	B-A
and	O
nonexistent	O
customer	B-A
service	I-A

bad	O
staff	B-A

I	O
generally	O
like	O
this	O
place	B-A

The	O
food	B-A
is	O
good	O

The	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
space	B-A
is	O
good	O

But	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
HORRID	O

I	O
was	O
there	O
for	O
brunch	O
recently	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
tag	O
teamed	O
by	O
a	O
waitress	B-A
and	O
a	O
waiter	B-A

The	O
waiter	B-A
delivered	O
our	O
food	O
while	O
holding	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
plastic	O
bag	O
of	O
garbage	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O

I	O
cant	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
please	O
put	O
the	O
bag	O
down	O
before	O
delivering	O
food	O

The	O
waitress	B-A
came	O
to	O
check	O
in	O
on	O
us	O
