This	O

than	O

the	O
worst	O

we	O

Our	O

for	O
the	O

a	O

in	O

its	O

to	O

a	O

and	O
just	O
plain	O
delivers	O
high	O
quality	O
food	B-A
and	O

period	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
place	B-A
to	O
relax	O
and	O
enjoy	O
the	O
finest	O
quality	O

the	O

Caution	O
its	O
real	O
food	B-A
for	O
people	O
who	O
love	O
the	O
best	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
food	O
is	O
clearly	O
oriented	O
toward	O
foodies	O
like	O
me	O
so	O
if	O
your	O
not	O
a	O
foodie	O
nothing	O
wrong	O
with	O
that	O
head	O
over	O
to	O
McDonalds	O
or	O
some	O
Ruby	O
Tuesday	O
and	O
have	O
at	O
it	O

If	O
your	O
looking	O
for	O
real	O
quality	O
not	O
the	O
BS	O
that	O
is	O
seen	O
on	O
yelp	O
ratings	O
which	O
allegedly	O
recently	O
got	O
in	O
trouble	O
for	O
adjusting	O
ratings	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
here	O

Very	O
Disappointing	O

–	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
parents	O
here	O
for	O
their	O
anniversaryvery	O
very	O
disappointed	O

I	O
liked	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-A
very	O
much	O
but	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
price	O

I	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
sushi	O
guru	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-A
here	O
is	O
just	O
okay	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
much	O
else	O
to	O
it	O

Rice	B-A
is	O
too	O
dry	O
tuna	B-A
wasnt	O
so	O
fresh	O
either	O

Nothing	O
really	O
came	O
across	O
as	O
outstanding	O

Very	O
disappointed	O

I	O
have	O
eaten	O
here	O
three	O
times	O
and	O
have	O
found	O
the	O
quality	O
and	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O
fish	B-A
to	O
be	O
excellent	O

However	O
the	O
value	O
and	O
service	B-A
are	O
both	O
severely	O
lacking	O

Portions	O
contain	O
less	O
fish	O
than	O
one	O
would	O
expect	O
particularly	O
since	O
prices	O
are	O
in	O
line	O
with	O
the	O
best	O
sushi	O
places	O
in	O
NYC	O
Masa	O
excluded	O
of	O
course	O

Furthermore	O
while	O
the	O
fish	B-A
is	O
unquestionably	O
fresh	O
rolls	B-A
tend	O
to	O
be	O
inexplicably	O
bland	O

The	O
service	B-A
ranges	O
from	O
mediocre	O
to	O
offensive	O

On	O
a	O
recent	O
trip	O
our	O
waiter	B-A
was	O
extremely	O
dismissive	O
while	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
staff	B-A
members	I-A
waited	O
handandfoot	O
on	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
Japanese	O
girls	O
seated	O
nearby	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
charged	O
for	O
their	O
most	O
expensive	O
sake	O
20	O
per	O
serving	O
when	O
we	O
in	O
fact	O
drank	O
a	O
sake	O
of	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
that	O
price	O

But	O
Im	O
sure	O
this	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
honest	O
mistake	O

Freshest	O
sushi	B-A
–	O
I	O
love	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A

They	O
pay	O
such	O
detail	O
to	O
everything	O
from	O
miso	B-A
soup	I-A
to	O
complex	O
rolls	B-A

The	O
sashimi	B-A
was	O
the	O
freshest	O
and	O
most	O
tender	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
tasted	O

Their	O
apps	B-A
are	O
all	O
delicious	O

The	O
only	O
drawback	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
place	B-A
is	O
really	O
expensive	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-A
are	O
on	O
the	O
small	O
side	O

But	O
the	O
space	B-A
is	O
small	O
and	O
lovely	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
is	O
helpful	O

You	O
are	O
bound	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
charming	O
time	O

Not	O
recommanded	O

–	O
The	O
food	B-A
was	O
not	O

the	O

worth	O
going	O
at	O
all	O

there	O

negative	O
comment	O
is	O
that	O
I	O

The	O

The	O

The	O

Mediocre	O
food	B-A

–	O
We	O
ate	O
on	O
the	O

for	O

on	O
a	O

My	O
gf	O
and	O
I	O
both	O
agreed	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
very	O
mediocre	O
especially	O
considering	O
the	O
price	O

We	O
are	O
locals	O
and	O
get	O
the	O
feeling	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
this	O
place	B-A
survives	O
with	O
such	O
average	O
food	B-A
is	O
because	O
most	O
customers	O
are	O
probably	O
onetime	O

Service	B-A
was	O
decent	O

Drinks	B-A
were	O

in	O
for	O
a	O

I	O

You	O
are	O

to	O

Excellent	O
food	B-A

I	O

and	O
the	O

gnocchi	I-A
5	O

break	O
amongst	O

that	O
kept	O
up	O
the	O
feeling	O
of	O
being	O
in	O

I	O
recommend	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
night	O

–	O
Ive	O
been	O
to	O
over	O
a	O
dozen	O
Indian	O
places	O
in	O
LA	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
still	O
my	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
is	O
the	O
prices	O
are	O

curry	I-A
and	O

Never	O
too	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
probably	O
tried	O
each	O
item	O
on	O
their	O

at	O

once	O

The	O
food	B-A
was	O
all	O
good	O
but	O
it	O
was	O

Normally	O

ask	O
how	O
hot	O
you	O
want	O
it	O
but	O
they	O
didnt	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
to	O
bring	O
it	O
up	O
but	O
never	O
expected	O
the	O
food	B-A
to	O
be	O
that	O
mild	O

I	O
will	O
give	O
them	O
another	O
chance	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
to	O
kick	O
it	O
up	O
several	O

The	O

though	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

which	O
I	O
believe	O
is	O
the	O

The	O
only	O
drawback	O
is	O
the	O

the	O

several	O

when	O

My	O
first	O
time	O
to	O
dine	O
at	O
this	O
restaurant	B-A
was	O
with	O
my	O
son	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
absolutely	O
horrible	O

We	O
waited	O
over	O
30	O
minutes	O
for	O
our	O
drinks	O
and	O
over	O
1	O
12	O
hours	O
for	O
our	O
food	O

I	O
swore	O
never	O
to	O
return	O
for	O
a	O
warm	O
beer	B-A
and	O
mediocre	O
meal	B-A

HOWEVER	O
one	O
Sunday	O
afternoon	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
go	O
although	O
with	O
my	O
loud	O
protests	O
and	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
surprised	O

The	O
band	B-A
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-A
was	O
attentive	O

Outside	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
between	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
the	O
park	O
children	O
were	O
running	O
around	O
while	O
their	O
parents	O
sipped	O
wine	O

We	O
ordered	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

were	O
all	O
very	O
good	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
dining	O
at	O
a	O
completely	O
different	O

We	O
have	O
since	O
returned	O
and	O
also	O
had	O
a	O

more	O
small	O

and	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
the	O

good	O

We	O
did	O
have	O
the	O

waiter	B-A
the	O
second	O

so	O
maybe	O
the	O
service	O
is	O
spotty	O
and	O
our	O

Sunday	O

the	O

you	O
can	O

I	O
went	O
there	O
with	O
a	O

from	O
out	O
of	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
both	O
very	O

Went	O
on	O
a	O
Monday	O
night	O
so	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

for	O
a	O

The	O
sushi	B-A
was	O
excellent	O
and	O
the	O
wait	B-A

was	O
quick	O

The	O
price	O
was	O
right	O
too	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-A
was	O
just	O
okay	O

Space	B-A
was	O
limited	O
but	O
the	O

made	O
up	O
for	O
it	O

Id	O
go	O

there	O

Should	O

My	O

went	O
on	O
a	O
midweek	O

to	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
80	O
full	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
sign	O
posted	O
wait	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O

Well	O
I	O
guess	O
its	O
hard	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
when	O
one	O
is	O
invisible	O
to	O
the	O
staff	B-A

We	O
stood	O
there	O
for	O
10	O
minutes	O
while	O
employees	B-A
walked	O
back	O
and	O
forth	O
ignoring	O
us	O

Finally	O
my	O
wife	O
stood	O
face	O
to	O
face	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
staff	B-A
and	O
she	O
asked	O
Are	O
you	O
waiting	O
for	O
a	O
table	O

Once	O
seated	O
it	O
took	O
about	O
30	O
minutes	O
to	O
finally	O
get	O

which	O

nothing	O
exceptional	O

is	O

with	O
my	O
feelings	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

We	O
used	O
to	O
frequent	O
most	O
of	O

but	O
over	O
the	O

each	O
one	O
has	O
really	O

Im	O

and	O
was	O
excited	O
to	O
hear	O

Well	O
I	O
guess	O
maybe	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
beneficial	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
pay	O

–	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
groupon	O
for	O

decided	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
thursday	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
guy	O
playing	O
the	O

singing	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O

which	O
was	O

You	O
can	O
easily	O
hear	O
him	O
though	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
pleasant	O
sound	O
and	O
not	O
overbearing	O

the	O
ambiance	B-A
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
good	O
for	O
fine	O
dinning	O

not	O
too	O
fine	O
thought	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
uncomfortable	O
and	O
have	O
to	O
dress	O
up	O

the	O
staff	B-A
was	O
very	O
nice	O
and	O
courteous	O
and	O
obviously	O
chinese	O

we	O
ordered	O
the	O
honey	O
walnut	O
prawns	O
which	O
we	O
always	O
order	O
at	O
every	O
chinese	O
restaurant	O
to	O
determine	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
food	O

First	O
off	O
the	O
food	O
came	O
fast	O
and	O
all	O
together	O
i	O
like	O
that	O
i	O
hate	O
the	O
pretentiousness	O
of	O
things	O
coming	O
in	O
one	O
after	O
the	O
other	O

so	O
about	O
the	O
prawns	B-A
they	O
were	O
fresh	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
slight	O
crispiness	O
about	O
the	O
batter	B-A
soooo	O
good	O
the	O
walnuts	B-A
were	O
cut	O
in	O
smaller	O
pieces	O
and	O
very	O
crunchy	O
and	O
tasty	O

yummy	O

best	O
honey	B-A

that	O
we	O

next	O
one	O
that	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
prawns	O
and	O
scallop	O
with	O
brocolli	O

the	O
brocollis	B-A
were	O
so	O
fresh	O
and	O
tasty	O

i	O
would	O
normally	O
not	O
finish	O
the	O
brocolli	B-A
when	O
i	O
order	O
these	O
kinds	O
of	O
food	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
every	O

was	O
as	O
eventful	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
the	O

these	O
that	O

The	O

perfectly	O
good	O
but	O
for	O
5	O
a	O
piece	O
either	O
the	O

no	O

that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
moderately	O

restaurant	B-A
even	O
for	O

We	O
easily	O
spent	O
more	O
than	O
40	O
per	O
person	O
not	O
including	O
alcohol	O
and	O
were	O
still	O
hungry	O

Im	O
astonished	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
categorized	O
as	O
rather	O

ok	O

–	O
This	O
past	O
weekend	O
had	O
great	O
weather	O
for	O
San	O
Francisco	O
standards	O

So	O
for	O
the	O
after	O
beach	O
excursion	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
would	O
end	O
the	O
day	O
on	O
a	O
high	O
note	O
and	O
make	O
the	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
to	O
Park	O
Chalet	O

The	O
restaurant	O
was	O
busy	O
however	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
tables	O
open	O

We	O
put	O
out	O
name	O
down	O
and	O
although	O
there	O
were	O
open	O
tables	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
itd	O
be	O
a	O
30	O
minute	O
wait	O

So	O
here	O
we	O
are	O
my	O
wife	O
3	O
year	O
old	O
daughter	O
and	O
I	O
trying	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
time	O
by	O
hanging	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
building	O
where	O
the	O
murals	O
and	O
artifacts	O
are	O

30	O
minutes	O
went	O
by	O
and	O
sure	O
enough	O
the	O
pager	O
buzzer	O
went	O
off	O

We	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
restaurant	O
and	O
low	O
and	O
behold	O
we	O
were	O
seated	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
tables	O
that	O
was	O
available	O
30	O
minutes	O
ago	O

Logic	O
behind	O
that	O

None	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
think	O
of	O

We	O
put	O
in	O
our	O
order	O
and	O
although	O
we	O
ordered	O
4	O
appetizers	O
the	O
food	O
didnt	O
arrive	O
until	O
45	O
minutes	O
laterWITH	O
OUR	O
MAIN	O
COURSE	O

Um	O
so	O
now	O
what	O
are	O
appetizers	O
for	O

Oh	O
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
mention	O
that	O
they	O
dont	O
have	O
bread	O
service	O

Its	O
a	O
good	O
thing	O
my	O
daughter	O
had	O
some	O
snacks	O
in	O
her	O
lunch	O
bag	O

My	O
wife	O
also	O
ordered	O
a	O
teapot	O
of	O
hot	O
water	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
sore	O
throat	O
and	O
I	O
guess	O
that	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
water	O
it	O
wasnt	O
a	O
priority	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
actually	O
bring	O
it	O

In	O
other	O
words	O
if	O
they	O
arent	O
making	O
off	O
of	O
you	O
then	O
you	O
dont	O
rate	O
high	O
on	O
their	O
service	B-A
scale	O

Food	B-A
wise	O
its	O
ok	O
but	O
a	O
bit	O
pricey	O
for	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
considering	O
the	O
restaurant	B-A
isnt	O
a	O
fancy	O
place	O

The	O
upside	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O

If	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
name	O
some	O
they	O
would	O
include	O
the	O
location	B-A
to	O
the	O
beach	O
or	O
Golden	O
Gate	O
park	O

Its	O
great	O
if	O
you	O
spent	O
the	O
day	O
there	O
and	O
didnt	O
want	O
to	O
drive	O
to	O
eat	O

Parking	O
is	O
reasonably	O
good	O
they	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
lot	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
park	O
in	O
the	O
park	O
nearby	O

Another	O
plus	O
is	O
the	O
open	O
feel	B-A
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
with	O
glass	B-A
walls	I-A
on	O
all	O

Id	O
hate	O
for	O
tourists	O
to	O
go	O
to	O

and	O
think	O
that	O
this	O

how	O

to	O
eat	O
at	O

because	O
of	O
their	O
price	B-A
fixed	I-A
preshow	I-A
dinner	I-A

When	O
I	O
walked	O
in	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
aback	O
by	O
their	O
incredible	O
wood	B-A
decor	I-A

The	O
music	B-A
playing	O
was	O
very	O
hip	O
2030	O
something	O
pop	O
music	O
but	O
the	O
subwoofer	B-A
to	I-A
the	I-A
sound	I-A
system	I-A
was	O
located	O
under	O
my	O
seat	O
which	O
became	O
annoying	O
midway	O
through	O
dinner	O

We	O
were	O
quickly	O
seated	O
and	O
requested	O
the	O
special	O
dinner	O
which	O
came	O
with	O
1	O
Shellfish	O
and	O
Shrimp	O
appetizer	O
or	O
Caesar	O
Salad	O
2	O
9	O
oz	O
steak	O
with	O
a	O
single	O
potato	O
chip	O
and	O
3	O
homemade	O
donut	O
holes	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
shellfish	B-A
and	I-A
shrimp	I-A
appetizer	I-A
and	O
it	O
was	O
alright	O

It	O
wasnt	O
the	O
freshest	O
seafood	B-A
ever	O
but	O
the	O
taste	O
and	O
presentation	O
was	O
OK	O

Before	O
the	O
steak	O
came	O
the	O
server	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
steak	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
with	O
any	O
sides	O
and	O
suggested	O
I	O
pick	O
something	O
from	O
the	O
menu	O

I	O
picked	O
the	O
asparagus	B-A
which	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
incredible	O
and	O
perfectly	O
prepared	O

It	O
was	O
steamed	O
and	O
tossed	O
with	O
garlic	O

The	O
9	B-A
oz	I-A
steak	I-A
came	O
next	O
and	O
it	O
tasted	O
great	O
at	O
least	O
initially	O

The	O
steak	B-A
was	O
done	O
to	O
my	O
exact	O
liking	O
medium	O
rare	O
and	O
was	O
nice	O
and	O
juicy	O

Its	O
served	O
with	O
either	O
a	O
peppercorn	B-A
sauce	I-A
or	O
red	B-A
wine	I-A
reduction	I-A
though	O
both	O
were	O
indistinguishable	O
in	O
taste	O

Though	O
one	O
thing	O
I	O
realized	O
later	O
on	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
restaurant	O
either	O
used	O
MSG	O
or	O
a	O
meat	O
tenderizer	O
on	O
the	O
steak	B-A

My	O
mouth	O
felt	O
very	O
dry	O
afterwards	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
that	O
signature	O
MSG	O
taste	O
lingering	O
in	O
my	O
throat	O
after	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
restaurant	O

Finally	O
the	O
homemade	O
donut	O
holes	O
were	O
served	O
for	O
desert	O

They	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
nifty	O
take	O
out	O
box	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
homemade	O
frosting	O
very	O
light	O
and	O
nottoosweet	O

The	O
desert	B-A
was	O
the	O
perfect	O
ending	O
to	O
an	O
almost	O
perfect	O
dinner	B-A

The	O
dinner	O
only	O
took	O
us	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
were	O
alright	O
for	O
the	O
strip	O
almost	O
50pp	O
after	O
tax	O
and	O
tip	O
about	O

But	O
the	O
servers	B-A
were	O
extremely	O
attentive	O
and	O
very	O
friendly	O

Overall	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
and	O
eat	O
at	O
the	O

again	O

a	O

and	O
the	O

Also	O
there	O
was	O
only	O
one	O

more	O

Most	O

we	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O
about	O
the	O
food	O
after	O
seeing	O
the	O
very	O
creative	O
menu	B-A

At	O
best	O
the	O
food	B-A
was	O
good	O
and	O
definately	O
overpriced	O

For	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O

we	O
got	O
the	O

should	O
have	O

they	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
busy	O
which	O
probably	O
accounts	O
for	O
the	O

for	O
it	O

Snooze	O
has	O
people	O

over	O
each	O

for	O
a	O
chance	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
this	O
overpriced	O

with	O

this	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
negative	O
ones	O
for	O
their	O
Larimer	O

unaddressed	O

The	O
presentation	O
of	O
Snooze	B-A
is	O
excellent	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
places	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
more	O
sophisticated	O
just	O
for	O
being	O
there	O
but	O
peel	O
back	O
the	O
layers	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
overpriced	O
IHOP	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
brow	O
menu	B-A

To	O
start	O
off	O
approximately	O
810	O
oz	O
of	O
orange	B-A
juice	I-A
will	O
cost	O
you	O
3	O

They	O
serve	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
tall	O
skinny	O
hourglass	O
shaped	O
glass	O
to	O
disguise	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
a	O
getting	O
a	O
small	O
juice	B-A
at	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
a	O
half	O
gallon	O
in	O
a	O
supermarket	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
just	O
asked	O
for	O
the	O
check	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
but	O
their	O
menu	B-A
was	O
so	O
unique	O
that	O
I	O
continued	O

The	O
pancakes	B-A
were	O
certainly	O
inventive	O
but	O
850	O
for	O
3	O
6	O
pancakes	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
5	O
in	O
the	O
pancake	O
flight	O
sample	O
of	O
3	O
different	O
pancakes	O
is	O
well	O
overpriced	O

The	O
pancakes	B-A
should	O
be	O
larger	O
at	O
least	O
8	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
expense	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
unique	O
offerings	O

The	O
flavors	O
were	O
good	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
far	O
better	O
pancakes	O
at	O
a	O
German	O
pancake	O
specialty	O
restaurant	O
that	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
cheaper	O
but	O
significantly	O
larger	O

On	O
my	O
meal	B-A
I	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
back	O
my	O
eggs	B-A
for	O
a	O
simple	O
request	O
of	O
breaking	O
the	O
yokes	O
before	O
cooking	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
them	O
back	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
hadnt	O
rejected	O
the	O
meal	O
all	O
together	O

I	O
rejected	O
it	O
because	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
attempting	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
eggs	O
they	O
broke	O
something	O
else	O
in	O
the	O
dish	B-A
and	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
frustrated	O
to	O
continue	O

To	O
their	O
credit	O
they	O
removed	O
the	O
dish	O
from	O
the	O
check	O
but	O
no	O
manager	B-A
stopped	O
by	O
to	O
ask	O
what	O
the	O
problem	O
was	O

In	O
the	O
end	O
our	O
check	O
came	O

an	O

This	O

what	O
the	O

Much	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
a	O
great	O
view	B-A

–	O
I	O
am	O
exceedingly	O
pleased	O
to	O
report	O
that	O
my	O
dinner	O
at	O
Rays	B-A
Boathouse	I-A
last	O
Friday	O
completely	O
exceeded	O
my	O
expectations	O

Rays	O
is	O
something	O
of	O
a	O
Seattle	O
institution	O
but	O
given	O
its	O
gorgeous	O
Sound	B-A
views	I-A
I	O
had	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
accolades	O
were	O
more	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
scenery	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
food	O
and	O
service	O

Imagine	O
my	O
happy	O
surprise	O
upon	O
finding	O
that	O
the	O
views	B-A
are	O
only	O
the	O
thirdbest	O
thing	O
about	O
Rays	B-A

To	O
start	O

our	O

Brooke	B-A
was	O
quickly	O
on	O

to	O

my	O

My	O

ambitious	O
and	O
we	O
splurged	O
on	O
the	O

a	O

For	O
my	O

I	O

sea	I-A
scallops	I-A
complemented	O
by	O
chard	O
artichoke	O
hearts	O

and	O
pecorino	O
toscano	O

The	O
scallops	B-A
are	O
apparently	O
cooked	O
in	O
a	O
black	O
olive	O

which	O
really	O
makes	O
them	O
unique	O
not	O

My	O

with	O

creamed	B-A
Washington	I-A
russet	I-A

I	O
had	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
all	O
three	O
items	O
on	O
her	O
plate	B-A
and	O
they	O
were	O
superb	O

Our	O
server	B-A
continued	O
to	O
be	O
attentive	O
throughout	O
the	O
night	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
remain	O
puzzled	O
by	O
one	O
issue	O
Who	O
thinks	O
that	O
Rays	B-A
is	O
an	O
appropriate	O
place	O
to	O
take	O
young	O
children	O
for	O
dinner	O

Two	O
rascally	O
kids	O
were	O
seated	O
near	O
us	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
dinnerthey	O
were	O
replaced	O
by	O
a	O

who	O
pretended	O
to	O
gag	O
every	O
time	O
seafood	O
was	O
mentioned	O
at	O
her	O
table	O

Given	O
that	O
Rays	O
is	O
a	O
seafood	O
restaurantwell	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
idea	O

All	O
considered	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
Rays	B-A
Boathouse	I-A
is	O
deserving	O
of	O
its	O
title	O
as	O
a	O
Seattle	O
institution	O

While	O
I	O
could	O
have	O

without	O
